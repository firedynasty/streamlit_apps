1. 5. Paul strongly condemns false teachers – He wishes :emely important pure

teaching is. We must make sure that we accurately divide

the Word of Truth so we don’t even accidentally become

false teachers.

Application: Where have you encountered false teaching

recently? When you encounter it, what should you do about

it?

it?

III. Do not abuse your freedom (13-15)

Discussion Questions

If an unbeliever asks you “what does it mean that you

have freedom after salvation” how would you answer?

How might some professing believers abuse this

freedom?

How does Paul teach us we should use our freedom?

What are some examples of Biblical commands that

relate to love?

Cross-References

2 Corinthians 3:17 – Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where

the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.

1 Peter 2:16 – Live as people who are free, not using your

freedom as a cover-up for evil, but living as servants of God.

John 8:32 – And you will know the truth, and the truth will

set you free.

Teaching Points
2. 1. Pleasing God, not man – Paul notes his motivation : of a desire to build up his own

reputation or power for his own sake. If he was in it for

himself, he says that he would not be a servant of Christ.

After all, his work as a missionary did not pay very well. He

suffered great pain and trials because of his service for

God. He was not enriched materially. He likely did not even

get married because of his call to spread the gospel. Finally

he died as a martyr.

He didn’t do these things for himself and he didn’t do them

in order to get a better reputation. He did what he did to

please God. That is a powerful testimony and the best

testimony one can have of his life.

Application: Can you say the same thing? Can you say

that you are trying to please God or please people? Think

for a moment about something you have done before out of

a motive to please others instead of God. Confess to God

and ask Him to help you have pure motivations.
3. 5. After beginning by the Spirit, are you now trying :rks. The gospel

message that Paul preached to them was very clear.

Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved.

Nothing more. Nothing less. The “formula” is not believe in

Christ to get saved and then keep doing good works on your

own to stay saved.

Book of Galatians Bible Study - Galatians 3:1-9

We can’t get in by our works. And we can’t stay in by our

works.

Application: How is this principle helpful for our life today?

What application can we make from this? The key lesson is

that we have to be humble and continually depend on Christ

rather than ourselves.

Galatians 4:1-11 Inductive Bible

Questions and
5. 5. We did not yield in submission – No compromise! Fo: just let Titus

be circumcised. After all, it is not sinful to be circumcised.

The problem is that if he gave in, the false teachers would

take it as proof that circumcision was always necessary.

They would say even Paul required his disciples to be

circumcised. Then the true gospel would be in danger of

being forever tainted by a works based foundation.

Application: There are many areas we can and should

compromise in. We should compromise when our personal

preferences or convenience is at stake. For example, I

shouldn’t always demand that my family eat what I like or go

where I like. But on Biblical issues, where the Bible speaks

clearly, we must not compromise. How do we balance

Christian unity with no compromising on truth?

Note that Paul refused to compromise on a gospel essential

issue. The entire gospel is at stake. We should not

compromise on our Biblical convictions, but neither should

we promote disunity or gravitate to conflict.

This a difficult balance to maintain. Many believers go off on

one side or the other. Some enjoy arguing. They will latch

on to any disagreement with other believers, even on small

issues, and argue about it. Their attitude is often prideful

and they will look down on others if they don’t agree with

them.
