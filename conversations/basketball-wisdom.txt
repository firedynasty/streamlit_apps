PROVERBS 2:1-22 - THE VALUE OF WISDOM
¹My son, if you receive my words and treasure up my commandments with you, ²making your ear attentive to wisdom and inclining your heart to understanding; ³yes, if you call out for insight and raise your voice for understanding, ⁴if you seek it like silver and search for it as for hidden treasures, ⁵then you will understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God. ⁶For the Lord gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding; ⁷he stores up sound wisdom for the upright; he is a shield to those who walk in integrity, ⁸guarding the paths of justice and watching over the way of his saints. ⁹Then you will understand righteousness and justice and equity, every good path; ¹⁰for wisdom will come into your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul; ¹¹discretion will watch over you, understanding will guard you, ¹²delivering you from the way of evil, from men of perverted speech, ¹³who forsake the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness, ¹⁴who rejoice in doing evil and delight in the perverseness of evil, ¹⁵men whose paths are crooked, and who are devious in their ways. ¹⁶So you will be delivered from the forbidden woman, from the adulteress with her smooth words, ¹⁷who forsakes the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God; ¹⁸for her house sinks down to death, and her paths to the departed; ¹⁹none who go to her come back, nor do they regain the paths of life. ²⁰So you will walk in the way of the good and keep to the paths of the righteous. ²¹For the upright will inhabit the land, and those with integrity will remain in it, ²²but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the treacherous will be rooted out of it.
 
REMEMBERING vs. FORGETTING
Genesis 8:1 - God remembered Noah after 150 days of flood
Proverbs 3:1 - "My son, do not forget my teaching"
God's memory is perfect—He acts with perfect timing. Our memory is flawed—we forget lessons, wisdom, and what we've learned. Basketball becomes a place where both play out.
 
BASKETBALL AS WISDOM TEACHER
Just like Proverbs uses everyday situations to teach life lessons, basketball becomes a classroom for wisdom. The court reveals truths on
•	Character under pressure - How do you respond when things go wrong?
•	Teamwork over selfishness - Do you take the right shot or the glory shot?
•	Integrity when no one's watching - How do you play when refs miss calls?
•	Handling success and failure - Do you stay humble in victory, resilient in defeat?
•	Pursuit of excellence - Are you disciplined in practice, consistent in effort?
 
THE LARGER PURSUIT: RIGHTEOUSNESS
Basketball shows us who we really are when pressure hits. The game calls us toward something bigger than winning—it calls us toward righteousness: being people of integrity, character, and love both on and off the court.
On the court, righteousness looks like:
•	Playing with integrity even when refs miss calls
•	Lifting teammates up instead of tearing them down
•	Giving your best effort regardless of the score
•	Treating opponents with respect
•	Taking responsibility for mistakes
•	Using your skills to serve the team, not showcase yourself
 
DISCUSSION QUESTION
What do you think you have learned this season that you want to take with you after basketball is over (could be as a better teammate, friend, family member, coworker, student)?
 
RIGHTEOUSNESS = INTEGRITY ON THE COURT
The theme in Proverbs 2 is righteousness, but on the court that translates as integrity:
•	Not yelling at refs, Not getting upset at teammates
•	Give your best effort no matter the score
•	Treat opponents with respect
•	Take responsibility for mistakes
•	Use your skills for the team, not for yourself
 
WHY INTEGRITY MATTERS
Integrity is an ingredient for encouragement—both for ourselves and for other people. When you play with integrity, you build others up and create an environment where everyone can grow.
The opposite of integrity leads us toward sin, which means missing the mark. When we lose our integrity on the court—yelling, blaming, playing selfishly—we miss the mark of who we're called to be. Don't forget what the game is teaching you about life.

⏺ This is a thoughtful piece connecting biblical wisdom literature with the
  basketball court. Let me engage with you Socratically on this.

  ---
  The text draws a parallel between seeking wisdom "like silver" and "hidden
   treasures" (Proverbs 2:4) and the way basketball can reveal character.

  Here's what strikes me: the text says basketball "reveals truths" about
  who we are under pressure.

  Let me ask you this:

  When you think back on a specific moment in basketball (or any competitive
   situation)—a moment where things didn't go your way—what did your 
  reaction reveal about you?

  Was there a gap between how you actually responded and how you wanted to
  respond?

  And if there was a gap... what do you think created it?

> I feel like integrity is important dispite wanting to hurt someone yuo 
don't 

⏺ That's a real and honest observation. Integrity isn't the absence of
  wanting to retaliate—it's the choice not to when everything in you wants
  to.

  Let me ask you this:

  In that moment when you feel the urge to hurt someone back—what do you 
  think holds you back?

  Is it fear of consequences? Respect for yourself? Something you've been
  taught? Or something else entirely?

  And here's a follow-up to sit with: Does holding back feel like weakness 
  to you, or strength?

> self-focused vs. God focused 

⏺ That's a powerful distinction. When you're self-focused, the hurt demands
  a response—your pride, your ego, your sense of justice says make them pay.
   When you're God-focused, you're anchored in something bigger than the
  moment.

  Here's what I want you to consider:

  In the heat of a game—or a conflict—how do you actually shift from 
  self-focused to God-focused?

  Because knowing the difference is one thing. But when your blood is hot
  and someone just undercut you or disrespected you... what practically
  brings you back to that bigger picture?

  Is it a thought? A breath? A phrase you tell yourself? Something you've
  practiced?
