<a id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV.<br>
IN WHICH IS RELATED THE UNFORTUNATE ADVENTURE THAT DON QUIXOTE FELL IN
WITH WHEN HE FELL OUT WITH CERTAIN HEARTLESS YANGUESANS
</h3>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
The sage Cid Hamete Benengeli relates that as soon as Don Quixote took
leave of his hosts and all who had been present at the burial of
Chrysostom, he and his squire passed into the same wood which they had
seen the shepherdess Marcela enter, and after having wandered for more
than two hours in all directions in search of her without finding her,
they came to a halt in a glade covered with tender grass, beside which ran
a pleasant cool stream that invited and compelled them to pass there the
hours of the noontide heat, which by this time was beginning to come on
oppressively. Don Quixote and Sancho dismounted, and turning Rocinante and
the ass loose to feed on the grass that was there in abundance, they
ransacked the alforjas, and without any ceremony very peacefully and
sociably master and man made their repast on what they found in them.
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
<img alt="c15b.jpg (376K)" src="images/c15b.jpg" style="width:100%;" id="img_images_c15b.jpg">
</div>
<p>
<a href="images/c15b.jpg" style="width:100%;" id="id-589477299106995669"><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg" id="img_images_enlarge.jpg_31"></a><br>
<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
Sancho had not thought it worth while to hobble Rocinante, feeling sure,
from what he knew of his staidness and freedom from incontinence, that all
the mares in the Cordova pastures would not lead him into an impropriety.
Chance, however, and the devil, who is not always asleep, so ordained it
that feeding in this valley there was a drove of Galician ponies belonging
to certain Yanguesan carriers, whose way it is to take their midday rest
with their teams in places and spots where grass and water abound; and
that where Don Quixote chanced to be suited the Yanguesans’ purpose very
well. It so happened, then, that Rocinante took a fancy to disport himself
with their ladyships the ponies, and abandoning his usual gait and
demeanour as he scented them, he, without asking leave of his master, got
up a briskish little trot and hastened to make known his wishes to them;
they, however, it seemed, preferred their pasture to him, and received him
with their heels and teeth to such effect that they soon broke his girths
and left him naked without a saddle to cover him; but what must have been
worse to him was that the carriers, seeing the violence he was offering to
their mares, came running up armed with stakes, and so belaboured him that
they brought him sorely battered to the ground.
</p>
<p>
By this time Don Quixote and Sancho, who had witnessed the drubbing of
Rocinante, came up panting, and said Don Quixote to Sancho:
</p>
<p>
“So far as I can see, friend Sancho, these are not knights but base folk
of low birth: I mention it because thou canst lawfully aid me in taking
due vengeance for the insult offered to Rocinante before our eyes.”
</p>
<p>
“What the devil vengeance can we take,” answered Sancho, “if they are more
than twenty, and we no more than two, or, indeed, perhaps not more than
one and a half?”
</p>
<p>
“I count for a hundred,” replied Don Quixote, and without more words he
drew his sword and attacked the Yanguesans and excited and impelled by the
example of his master, Sancho did the same; and to begin with, Don Quixote
delivered a slash at one of them that laid open the leather jerkin he
wore, together with a great portion of his shoulder. The Yanguesans,
seeing themselves assaulted by only two men while they were so many,
betook themselves to their stakes, and driving the two into the middle
they began to lay on with great zeal and energy; in fact, at the second
blow they brought Sancho to the ground, and Don Quixote fared the same
way, all his skill and high mettle availing him nothing, and fate willed
it that he should fall at the feet of Rocinante, who had not yet risen;
whereby it may be seen how furiously stakes can pound in angry boorish
hands.
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
<img alt="c15c.jpg (362K)" src="images/c15c.jpg" style="width:100%;" id="img_images_c15c.jpg">
</div>
<p>
<a href="images/c15c.jpg" style="width:100%;" id="id-7775120022773994235"><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg" id="img_images_enlarge.jpg_32"></a><br>
<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
Then, seeing the mischief they had done, the Yanguesans with all the haste
they could loaded their team and pursued their journey, leaving the two
adventurers a sorry sight and in sorrier mood.
</p>
<p>
Sancho was the first to come to, and finding himself close to his master
he called to him in a weak and doleful voice, “Señor Don Quixote, ah,
Señor Don Quixote!”
</p>
<p>
“What wouldst thou, brother Sancho?” answered Don Quixote in the same
feeble suffering tone as Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“I would like, if it were possible,” answered Sancho Panza, “your worship
to give me a couple of sups of that potion of the fiery Blas, if it be
that you have any to hand there; perhaps it will serve for broken bones as
well as for wounds.”
</p>
<p>
“If I only had it here, wretch that I am, what more should we want?” said
Don Quixote; “but I swear to thee, Sancho Panza, on the faith of a
knight-errant, ere two days are over, unless fortune orders otherwise, I
mean to have it in my possession, or my hand will have lost its cunning.”
</p>
<p>
“But in how many does your worship think we shall have the use of our
feet?” answered Sancho Panza.
</p>
<p>
“For myself I must say I cannot guess how many,” said the battered
knight Don Quixote; “but I take all the blame upon myself, for I had no
business to put hand to sword against men who where not dubbed knights like
myself, and so I believe that in punishment for having transgressed the laws of
chivalry the God of battles has permitted this chastisement to be administered
to me; for which reason, brother Sancho, it is well thou shouldst receive a
hint on the matter which I am now about to mention to thee, for it is of much
importance to the welfare of both of us. It is that when thou shalt see rabble
of this sort offering us insult thou art not to wait till I draw sword against
them, for I shall not do so at all; but do thou draw sword and chastise them to
thy heart’s content, and if any knights come to their aid and defence I
will take care to defend thee and assail them with all my might; and thou hast
already seen by a thousand signs and proofs what the might of this strong arm
of mine is equal to”—so uplifted had the poor gentleman become
through the victory over the stout Biscayan.
</p>
<p>
But Sancho did not so fully approve of his master’s admonition as to let
it pass without saying in reply, “Señor, I am a man of peace, meek and
quiet, and I can put up with any affront because I have a wife and
children to support and bring up; so let it be likewise a hint to your
worship, as it cannot be a mandate, that on no account will I draw sword
either against clown or against knight, and that here before God I forgive
the insults that have been offered me, whether they have been, are, or
shall be offered me by high or low, rich or poor, noble or commoner, not
excepting any rank or condition whatsoever.”
</p>
<p>
To all which his master said in reply, “I wish I had breath enough to
speak somewhat easily, and that the pain I feel on this side would abate
so as to let me explain to thee, Panza, the mistake thou makest. Come now,
sinner, suppose the wind of fortune, hitherto so adverse, should turn in
our favour, filling the sails of our desires so that safely and without
impediment we put into port in some one of those islands I have promised
thee, how would it be with thee if on winning it I made thee lord of it?
Why, thou wilt make it well-nigh impossible through not being a knight nor
having any desire to be one, nor possessing the courage nor the will to
avenge insults or defend thy lordship; for thou must know that in newly
conquered kingdoms and provinces the minds of the inhabitants are never so
quiet nor so well disposed to the new lord that there is no fear of their
making some move to change matters once more, and try, as they say, what
chance may do for them; so it is essential that the new possessor should
have good sense to enable him to govern, and valour to attack and defend
himself, whatever may befall him.”
</p>
<p>
“In what has now befallen us,” answered Sancho, “I’d have been well
pleased to have that good sense and that valour your worship speaks of,
but I swear on the faith of a poor man I am more fit for plasters than for
arguments. See if your worship can get up, and let us help Rocinante,
though he does not deserve it, for he was the main cause of all this
thrashing. I never thought it of Rocinante, for I took him to be a
virtuous person and as quiet as myself. After all, they say right that it
takes a long time to come to know people, and that there is nothing sure
in this life. Who would have said that, after such mighty slashes as your
worship gave that unlucky knight-errant, there was coming, travelling post
and at the very heels of them, such a great storm of sticks as has fallen
upon our shoulders?”
</p>
<p>
“And yet thine, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote, “ought to be used to such
squalls; but mine, reared in soft cloth and fine linen, it is plain they
must feel more keenly the pain of this mishap, and if it were not that I
imagine—why do I say imagine?—know of a certainty that all
these annoyances are very necessary accompaniments of the calling of arms,
I would lay me down here to die of pure vexation.”
</p>
<p>
To this the squire replied, “Señor, as these mishaps are what one reaps of
chivalry, tell me if they happen very often, or if they have their own
fixed times for coming to pass; because it seems to me that after two
harvests we shall be no good for the third, unless God in his infinite
mercy helps us.”
</p>
<p>
“Know, friend Sancho,” answered Don Quixote, “that the life of
knights-errant is subject to a thousand dangers and reverses, and neither
more nor less is it within immediate possibility for knights-errant to
become kings and emperors, as experience has shown in the case of many
different knights with whose histories I am thoroughly acquainted; and I
could tell thee now, if the pain would let me, of some who simply by might
of arm have risen to the high stations I have mentioned; and those same,
both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes and miseries; for
the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortal enemy
Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him
captive, gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse
while tied to one of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a
certain recondite author of no small authority who says that the Knight of
Phœbus, being caught in a certain pitfall, which opened under his feet in
a certain castle, on falling found himself bound hand and foot in a deep
pit underground, where they administered to him one of those things they
call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh finished him; and if
he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, a great friend
of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I may well
suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignities
which they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee
know, Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance
to be in hand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of
the duel in express words: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another
with the last which he has in his hand, though it be in fact a piece of
wood, it cannot be said for that reason that he whom he struck with it has
been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imagine that because we have
been drubbed in this affray we have therefore suffered any indignity; for
the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, were nothing more
than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carried
rapier, sword, or dagger.”
</p>
<p>
“They gave me no time to see that much,” answered Sancho, “for hardly had
I laid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with
their sticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the
strength out of my feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking
of whether all those stake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no
uneasiness, which the pain of the blows does, for they will remain as
deeply impressed on my memory as on my shoulders.”
</p>
<p>
“For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza,” said Don Quixote, “that
there is no recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain
which death does not remove.”
</p>
<p>
“And what greater misfortune can there be,” replied Panza, “than the one
that waits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our
mishap were one of those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it
would not be so bad; but I am beginning to think that all the plasters in
a hospital almost won’t be enough to put us right.”
</p>
<p>
“No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to
do,” returned Don Quixote, “and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems
to me that not the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the
poor beast.”
</p>
<p>
“There is nothing wonderful in that,” replied Sancho, “since he is a
knight-errant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off
scot-free where we come out scotched.”
</p>
<p>
“Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief
to it,” said Don Quixote; “I say so because this little beast may now
supply the want of Rocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may
be cured of my wounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to
be so mounted, for I remember having read how the good old Silenus, the
tutor and instructor of the gay god of laughter, when he entered the city
of the hundred gates, went very contentedly mounted on a handsome ass.”
</p>
<p>
“It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says,” answered
Sancho, “but there is a great difference between going mounted and going
slung like a sack of manure.”
</p>
<p>
To which Don Quixote replied, “Wounds received in battle confer honour
instead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I
told thee before, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy
beast in whatever fashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night
come on and surprise us in these wilds.”
</p>
<p>
“And yet I have heard your worship say,” observed Panza, “that it is very
meet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they
esteem it very good fortune.”
</p>
<p>
“That is,” said Don Quixote, “when they cannot help it, or when they are
in love; and so true is this that there have been knights who have
remained two years on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the
inclemencies of heaven, without their ladies knowing anything of it; and
one of these was Amadis, when, under the name of Beltenebros, he took up
his abode on the Peña Pobre for—I know not if it was eight years or
eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; at any rate he
stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the Princess Oriana
had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste before a
mishap like Rocinante’s befalls the ass.”
</p>
<p>
“The very devil would be in it in that case,” said Sancho; and letting off
thirty “ohs,” and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and
execrations on whomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised
himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring
himself upright, but with all his pains he saddled his ass, who too had
gone astray somewhat, yielding to the excessive licence of the day; he
next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had he possessed a tongue to
complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his master would have
been behind him.

To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on the ass and secured Rocinante
with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, he proceeded more
or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high road might be;
and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to better,
he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he
perceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote
must needs be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his master
that it was not one, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that
before the point was settled they had time to reach it, and into it Sancho
entered with all his team without any further controversy.
