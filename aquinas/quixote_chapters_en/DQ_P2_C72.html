OF HOW DON QUIXOTE AND SANCHO REACHED THEIR VILLAGE

</p>
<p>
All that day Don Quixote and Sancho remained in the village and inn
waiting for night, the one to finish off his task of scourging in the open
country, the other to see it accomplished, for therein lay the
accomplishment of his wishes. Meanwhile there arrived at the hostelry a
traveller on horseback with three or four servants, one of whom said to
him who appeared to be the master, “Here, Señor Don Álvaro Tarfe,
your worship may take your siesta to-day; the quarters seem clean and
cool.”
</p>
<p>
When he heard this Don Quixote said to Sancho, “Look here, Sancho;
on turning over the leaves of that book of the Second Part of my history I
think I came casually upon this name of Don Álvaro Tarfe.”
</p>
<p>
“Very likely,” said Sancho; “we had better let him
dismount, and by-and-by we can ask about it.”
</p>
<p>
The gentleman dismounted, and the landlady gave him a room on the ground
floor opposite Don Quixote’s and adorned with painted serge hangings
of the same sort. The newly arrived gentleman put on a summer coat, and
coming out to the gateway of the hostelry, which was wide and cool,
addressing Don Quixote, who was pacing up and down there, he asked,
“In what direction is your worship bound, gentle sir?”
</p>
<p>
“To a village near this which is my own village,” replied Don
Quixote; “and your worship, where are you bound for?”
</p>
<p>
“I am going to Granada, señor,” said the gentleman, “to
my own country.”
</p>
<p>
“And a goodly country,” said Don Quixote; “but will your
worship do me the favour of telling me your name, for it strikes me it is
of more importance to me to know it than I can tell you.”
</p>
<p>
“My name is Don Álvaro Tarfe,” replied the traveller.
</p>
<p>
To which Don Quixote returned, “I have no doubt whatever that your
worship is that Don Álvaro Tarfe who appears in print in the Second Part
of the history of Don Quixote of La Mancha, lately printed and published
by a new author.”
</p>
<p>
“I am the same,” replied the gentleman; “and that same
Don Quixote, the principal personage in the said history, was a very great
friend of mine, and it was I who took him away from home, or at least
induced him to come to some jousts that were to be held at Saragossa,
whither I was going myself; indeed, I showed him many kindnesses, and
saved him from having his shoulders touched up by the executioner because
of his extreme rashness.”
</p>
<p>
“Tell me, Señor Don Álvaro,” said Don Quixote, “am I at
all like that Don Quixote you talk of?”
</p>
<p>
“No indeed,” replied the traveller, “not a bit.”
</p>
<p>
“And that Don Quixote—” said our one, “had he with him
a squire called Sancho Panza?”
</p>
<p>
“He had,” said Don Álvaro; “but though he had the name
of being very droll, I never heard him say anything that had any drollery
in it.”
</p>
<p>
“That I can well believe,” said Sancho at this, “for to
come out with drolleries is not in everybody’s line; and that Sancho
your worship speaks of, gentle sir, must be some great scoundrel,
dunderhead, and thief, all in one; for I am the real Sancho Panza, and I
have more drolleries than if it rained them; let your worship only try;
come along with me for a year or so, and you will find they fall from me
at every turn, and so rich and so plentiful that though mostly I don’t
know what I am saying I make everybody that hears me laugh. And the real
Don Quixote of La Mancha, the famous, the valiant, the wise, the lover,
the righter of wrongs, the guardian of minors and orphans, the protector
of widows, the killer of damsels, he who has for his sole mistress the
peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, is this gentleman before you, my master; all
other Don Quixotes and all other Sancho Panzas are dreams and mockeries.”
</p>
<p>
“By God I believe it,” said Don Álvaro; “for you have
uttered more drolleries, my friend, in the few words you have spoken than
the other Sancho Panza in all I ever heard from him, and they were not a
few. He was more greedy than well-spoken, and more dull than droll; and I
am convinced that the enchanters who persecute Don Quixote the Good have
been trying to persecute me with Don Quixote the Bad. But I don’t
know what to say, for I am ready to swear I left him shut up in the Casa
del Nuncio at Toledo, and here another Don Quixote turns up, though a very
different one from mine.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know whether I am good,” said Don Quixote,
“but I can safely say I am not ‘the Bad;’ and to prove
it, let me tell you, Señor Don Álvaro Tarfe, I have never in my life been
in Saragossa; so far from that, when it was told me that this imaginary
Don Quixote had been present at the jousts in that city, I declined to
enter it, in order to drag his falsehood before the face of the world; and
so I went on straight to Barcelona, the treasure-house of courtesy, haven
of strangers, asylum of the poor, home of the valiant, champion of the
wronged, pleasant exchange of firm friendships, and city unrivalled in
site and beauty. And though the adventures that befell me there are not by
any means matters of enjoyment, but rather of regret, I do not regret
them, simply because I have seen it. In a word, Señor Don Álvaro Tarfe, I
am Don Quixote of La Mancha, the one that fame speaks of, and not the
unlucky one that has attempted to usurp my name and deck himself out in my
ideas. I entreat your worship by your devoir as a gentleman to be so good
as to make a declaration before the alcalde of this village that you never
in all your life saw me until now, and that neither am I the Don Quixote
in print in the Second Part, nor this Sancho Panza, my squire, the one
your worship knew.”
</p>
<p>
“That I will do most willingly,” replied Don Álvaro; “though
it amazes me to find two Don Quixotes and two Sancho Panzas at once, as
much alike in name as they differ in demeanour; and again I say and
declare that what I saw I cannot have seen, and that what happened me
cannot have happened.”
</p>
<p>
“No doubt your worship is enchanted, like my lady Dulcinea del
Toboso,” said Sancho; “and would to heaven your disenchantment
rested on my giving myself another three thousand and odd lashes like what
I’m giving myself for her, for I’d lay them on without looking
for anything.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t understand that about the lashes,” said Don
Álvaro. Sancho replied that it was a long story to tell, but he would tell
him if they happened to be going the same road.
</p>
<p>
By this dinner-time arrived, and Don Quixote and Don Álvaro dined
together. The alcalde of the village came by chance into the inn together
with a notary, and Don Quixote laid a petition before him, showing that it
was requisite for his rights that Don Álvaro Tarfe, the gentleman there
present, should make a declaration before him that he did not know Don
Quixote of La Mancha, also there present, and that he was not the one that
was in print in a history entitled “Second Part of Don Quixote of La
Mancha, by one Avellaneda of Tordesillas.” The alcalde finally put
it in legal form, and the declaration was made with all the formalities
required in such cases, at which Don Quixote and Sancho were in high
delight, as if a declaration of the sort was of any great importance to
them, and as if their words and deeds did not plainly show the difference
between the two Don Quixotes and the two Sanchos. Many civilities and
offers of service were exchanged by Don Álvaro and Don Quixote, in the
course of which the great Manchegan displayed such good taste that he
disabused Don Álvaro of the error he was under; and he, on his part, felt
convinced he must have been enchanted, now that he had been brought in
contact with two such opposite Don Quixotes.
</p>
<p>
Evening came, they set out from the village, and after about half a league
two roads branched off, one leading to Don Quixote’s village, the
other the road Don Álvaro was to follow. In this short interval Don
Quixote told him of his unfortunate defeat, and of Dulcinea’s
enchantment and the remedy, all which threw Don Álvaro into fresh
amazement, and embracing Don Quixote and Sancho, he went his way, and Don
Quixote went his. That night he passed among trees again in order to give
Sancho an opportunity of working out his penance, which he did in the same
fashion as the night before, at the expense of the bark of the beech trees
much more than of his back, of which he took such good care that the
lashes would not have knocked off a fly had there been one there. The
duped Don Quixote did not miss a single stroke of the count, and he found
that together with those of the night before they made up three thousand
and twenty-nine. The sun apparently had got up early to witness the
sacrifice, and with his light they resumed their journey, discussing the
deception practised on Don Álvaro, and saying how well done it was to have
taken his declaration before a magistrate in such an unimpeachable form.
That day and night they travelled on, nor did anything worth mention
happen to them, unless it was that in the course of the night Sancho
finished off his task, whereat Don Quixote was beyond measure joyful. He
watched for daylight, to see if along the road he should fall in with his
already disenchanted lady Dulcinea; and as he pursued his journey there
was no woman he met that he did not go up to, to see if she was Dulcinea
del Toboso, as he held it absolutely certain that Merlin’s promises
could not lie. Full of these thoughts and anxieties, they ascended a
rising ground wherefrom they descried their own village, at the sight of
which Sancho fell on his knees exclaiming, “Open thine eyes,
longed-for home, and see how thy son Sancho Panza comes back to thee, if
not very rich, very well whipped! Open thine arms and receive, too, thy
son Don Quixote, who, if he comes vanquished by the arm of another, comes
victor over himself, which, as he himself has told me, is the greatest
victory anyone can desire. I’m bringing back money, for if I was
well whipped, I went mounted like a gentleman.”

</p>
<p>
“Have done with these fooleries,” said Don Quixote; “let
us push on straight and get to our own place, where we will give free
range to our fancies, and settle our plans for our future pastoral life.”
</p>
<p>
With this they descended the slope and directed their steps to their
village.
