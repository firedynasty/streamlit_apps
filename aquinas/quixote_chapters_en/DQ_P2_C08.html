“Blessed be Allah the all-powerful!” says Hamete Benengeli on
beginning this eighth chapter; “blessed be Allah!” he repeats
three times; and he says he utters these thanksgivings at seeing that he
has now got Don Quixote and Sancho fairly afield, and that the readers of
his delightful history may reckon that the achievements and humours of Don
Quixote and his squire are now about to begin; and he urges them to forget
the former chivalries of the ingenious gentleman and to fix their eyes on
those that are to come, which now begin on the road to El Toboso, as the
others began on the plains of Montiel; nor is it much that he asks in
consideration of all he promises, and so he goes on to say:
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote and Sancho were left alone, and the moment Samson took his
departure, Rocinante began to neigh, and Dapple to sigh, which, by both
knight and squire, was accepted as a good sign and a very happy omen;
though, if the truth is to be told, the sighs and brays of Dapple were
louder than the neighings of the hack, from which Sancho inferred that his
good fortune was to exceed and overtop that of his master, building,
perhaps, upon some judicial astrology that he may have known, though the
history says nothing about it; all that can be said is, that when he
stumbled or fell, he was heard to say he wished he had not come out, for
by stumbling or falling there was nothing to be got but a damaged shoe or
a broken rib; and, fool as he was, he was not much astray in this.
</p>
<p>
Said Don Quixote, “Sancho, my friend, night is drawing on upon us as
we go, and more darkly than will allow us to reach El Toboso by daylight;
for there I am resolved to go before I engage in another adventure, and
there I shall obtain the blessing and generous permission of the peerless
Dulcinea, with which permission I expect and feel assured that I shall
conclude and bring to a happy termination every perilous adventure; for
nothing in life makes knights-errant more valorous than finding themselves
favoured by their ladies.”
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
<img alt="p08b.jpg (283K)" src="images/p08b.jpg" style="width:100%;" id="img_images_p08b.jpg">

<a href="images/p08b.jpg" style="width:100%;" id="id-8496351495323486864"><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg" id="img_images_enlarge.jpg_129"></a><br><br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
“So I believe,” replied Sancho; “but I think it will be
difficult for your worship to speak with her or see her, at any rate where
you will be able to receive her blessing; unless, indeed, she throws it
over the wall of the yard where I saw her the time before, when I took her
the letter that told of the follies and mad things your worship was doing
in the heart of Sierra Morena.”
</p>
<p>
“Didst thou take that for a yard wall, Sancho,” said Don
Quixote, “where or at which thou sawest that never sufficiently
extolled grace and beauty? It must have been the gallery, corridor, or
portico of some rich and royal palace.”
</p>
<p>
“It might have been all that,” returned Sancho, “but to
me it looked like a wall, unless I am short of memory.”
</p>
<p>
“At all events, let us go there, Sancho,” said Don Quixote;
“for, so that I see her, it is the same to me whether it be over a
wall, or at a window, or through the chink of a door, or the grate of a
garden; for any beam of the sun of her beauty that reaches my eyes will
give light to my reason and strength to my heart, so that I shall be
unmatched and unequalled in wisdom and valour.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, to tell the truth, señor,” said Sancho, “when I
saw that sun of the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, it was not bright enough to
throw out beams at all; it must have been, that as her grace was sifting
that wheat I told you of, the thick dust she raised came before her face
like a cloud and dimmed it.”
</p>
<p>
“What! dost thou still persist, Sancho,” said Don Quixote,
“in saying, thinking, believing, and maintaining that my lady
Dulcinea was sifting wheat, that being an occupation and task entirely at
variance with what is and should be the employment of persons of
distinction, who are constituted and reserved for other avocations and
pursuits that show their rank a bowshot off? Thou hast forgotten, O
Sancho, those lines of our poet wherein he paints for us how, in their
crystal abodes, those four nymphs employed themselves who rose from their
loved Tagus and seated themselves in a verdant meadow to embroider those
tissues which the ingenious poet there describes to us, how they were
worked and woven with gold and silk and pearls; and something of this sort
must have been the employment of my lady when thou sawest her, only that
the spite which some wicked enchanter seems to have against everything of
mine changes all those things that give me pleasure, and turns them into
shapes unlike their own; and so I fear that in that history of my
achievements which they say is now in print, if haply its author was some
sage who is an enemy of mine, he will have put one thing for another,
mingling a thousand lies with one truth, and amusing himself by relating
transactions which have nothing to do with the sequence of a true history.
O envy, root of all countless evils, and cankerworm of the virtues! All
the vices, Sancho, bring some kind of pleasure with them; but envy brings
nothing but irritation, bitterness, and rage.”
</p>
<p>
“So I say too,” replied Sancho; “and I suspect in that
legend or history of us that the bachelor Samson Carrasco told us he saw,
my honour goes dragged in the dirt, knocked about, up and down, sweeping
the streets, as they say. And yet, on the faith of an honest man, I never
spoke ill of any enchanter, and I am not so well off that I am to be
envied; to be sure, I am rather sly, and I have a certain spice of the
rogue in me; but all is covered by the great cloak of my simplicity,
always natural and never acted; and if I had no other merit save that I
believe, as I always do, firmly and truly in God, and all the holy Roman
Catholic Church holds and believes, and that I am a mortal enemy of the
Jews, the historians ought to have mercy on me and treat me well in their
writings. But let them say what they like; naked was I born, naked I find
myself, I neither lose nor gain; nay, while I see myself put into a book
and passed on from hand to hand over the world, I don’t care a fig,
let them say what they like of me.”
</p>
<p>
“That, Sancho,” returned Don Quixote, “reminds me of
what happened to a famous poet of our own day, who, having written a
bitter satire against all the courtesan ladies, did not insert or name in
it a certain lady of whom it was questionable whether she was one or not.
She, seeing she was not in the list of the poet, asked him what he had
seen in her that he did not include her in the number of the others,
telling him he must add to his satire and put her in the new part, or else
look out for the consequences. The poet did as she bade him, and left her
without a shred of reputation, and she was satisfied by getting fame
though it was infamy. In keeping with this is what they relate of that
shepherd who set fire to the famous temple of Diana, by repute one of the
seven wonders of the world, and burned it with the sole object of making
his name live in after ages; and, though it was forbidden to name him, or
mention his name by word of mouth or in writing, lest the object of his
ambition should be attained, nevertheless it became known that he was
called Erostratus. And something of the same sort is what happened in the
case of the great emperor Charles V. and a gentleman in Rome. The emperor
was anxious to see that famous temple of the Rotunda, called in ancient
times the temple ‘of all the gods,’ but now-a-days, by a
better nomenclature, ‘of all the saints,’ which is the best
preserved building of all those of pagan construction in Rome, and the one
which best sustains the reputation of mighty works and magnificence of its
founders. It is in the form of a half orange, of enormous dimensions, and
well lighted, though no light penetrates it save that which is admitted by
a window, or rather round skylight, at the top; and it was from this that
the emperor examined the building. A Roman gentleman stood by his side and
explained to him the skilful construction and ingenuity of the vast fabric
and its wonderful architecture, and when they had left the skylight he
said to the emperor, ‘A thousand times, your Sacred Majesty, the
impulse came upon me to seize your Majesty in my arms and fling myself
down from yonder skylight, so as to leave behind me in the world a name
that would last for ever.’ ‘I am thankful to you for not
carrying such an evil thought into effect,’ said the emperor,
‘and I shall give you no opportunity in future of again putting your
loyalty to the test; and I therefore forbid you ever to speak to me or to
be where I am; and he followed up these words by bestowing a liberal
bounty upon him. My meaning is, Sancho, that the desire of acquiring fame
is a very powerful motive. What, thinkest thou, was it that flung Horatius
in full armour down from the bridge into the depths of the Tiber? What
burned the hand and arm of Mutius? What impelled Curtius to plunge into
the deep burning gulf that opened in the midst of Rome? What, in
opposition to all the omens that declared against him, made Julius Cæsar
cross the Rubicon? And to come to more modern examples, what scuttled the
ships, and left stranded and cut off the gallant Spaniards under the
command of the most courteous Cortés in the New World? All these and a
variety of other great exploits are, were and will be, the work of fame
that mortals desire as a reward and a portion of the immortality their
famous deeds deserve; though we Catholic Christians and knights-errant
look more to that future glory that is everlasting in the ethereal regions
of heaven than to the vanity of the fame that is to be acquired in this
present transitory life; a fame that, however long it may last, must after
all end with the world itself, which has its own appointed end. So that, O
Sancho, in what we do we must not overpass the bounds which the Christian
religion we profess has assigned to us. We have to slay pride in giants,
envy by generosity and nobleness of heart, anger by calmness of demeanour
and equanimity, gluttony and sloth by the spareness of our diet and the
length of our vigils, lust and lewdness by the loyalty we preserve to
those whom we have made the mistresses of our thoughts, indolence by
traversing the world in all directions seeking opportunities of making
ourselves, besides Christians, famous knights. Such, Sancho, are the means
by which we reach those extremes of praise that fair fame carries with it.”
</p>
<p>
“All that your worship has said so far,” said Sancho, “I
have understood quite well; but still I would be glad if your worship
would dissolve a doubt for me, which has just this minute come into my
mind.”
</p>
<p>
“Solve, thou meanest, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “say
on, in God’s name, and I will answer as well as I can.”
</p>
<p>
“Tell me, señor,” Sancho went on to say, “those Julys or
Augusts, and all those venturous knights that you say are now dead—where
are they now?”
</p>
<p>
“The heathens,” replied Don Quixote, “are, no doubt, in
hell; the Christians, if they were good Christians, are either in
purgatory or in heaven.”
</p>
<p>
“Very good,” said Sancho; “but now I want to know—the
tombs where the bodies of those great lords are, have they silver lamps
before them, or are the walls of their chapels ornamented with crutches,
winding-sheets, tresses of hair, legs and eyes in wax? Or what are they
ornamented with?”
</p>
<p>
To which Don Quixote made answer: “The tombs of the heathens were
generally sumptuous temples; the ashes of Julius Cæsar’s body were placed
on the top of a stone pyramid of vast size, which they now call in Rome Saint
Peter’s needle. The emperor Hadrian had for a tomb a castle as large as a
good-sized village, which they called the <i>Moles Adriani</i>, and is now the
castle of St. Angelo in Rome. The queen Artemisia buried her husband Mausolus
in a tomb which was reckoned one of the seven wonders of the world; but none of
these tombs, or of the many others of the heathens, were ornamented with
winding-sheets or any of those other offerings and tokens that show that they
who are buried there are saints.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s the point I’m coming to,” said Sancho;
“and now tell me, which is the greater work, to bring a dead man to
life or to kill a giant?”
</p>
<p>
“The answer is easy,” replied Don Quixote; “it is a
greater work to bring to life a dead man.”
</p>
<p>
“Now I have got you,” said Sancho; “in that case the
fame of them who bring the dead to life, who give sight to the blind, cure
cripples, restore health to the sick, and before whose tombs there are
lamps burning, and whose chapels are filled with devout folk on their
knees adoring their relics be a better fame in this life and in the other
than that which all the heathen emperors and knights-errant that have ever
been in the world have left or may leave behind them?”
</p>
<p>
“That I grant, too,” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“Then this fame, these favours, these privileges, or whatever you
call it,” said Sancho, “belong to the bodies and relics of the
saints who, with the approbation and permission of our holy mother Church,
have lamps, tapers, winding-sheets, crutches, pictures, eyes and legs, by
means of which they increase devotion and add to their own Christian
reputation. Kings carry the bodies or relics of saints on their shoulders,
and kiss bits of their bones, and enrich and adorn their oratories and
favourite altars with them.”
</p>
<p>
“What wouldst thou have me infer from all thou hast said, Sancho?”
asked Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“My meaning is,” said Sancho, “let us set about becoming
saints, and we shall obtain more quickly the fair fame we are striving
after; for you know, señor, yesterday or the day before yesterday (for it
is so lately one may say so) they canonised and beatified two little
barefoot friars, and it is now reckoned the greatest good luck to kiss or
touch the iron chains with which they girt and tortured their bodies, and
they are held in greater veneration, so it is said, than the sword of
Roland in the armoury of our lord the King, whom God preserve. So that,
señor, it is better to be an humble little friar of no matter what order,
than a valiant knight-errant; with God a couple of dozen of penance
lashings are of more avail than two thousand lance-thrusts, be they given
to giants, or monsters, or dragons.”
</p>
<p>
“All that is true,” returned Don Quixote, “but we cannot
all be friars, and many are the ways by which God takes his own to heaven;
chivalry is a religion, there are sainted knights in glory.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Sancho, “but I have heard say that there are
more friars in heaven than knights-errant.”
</p>
<p>
“That,” said Don Quixote, “is because those in religious
orders are more numerous than knights.”
</p>
<p>
“The errants are many,” said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“Many,” replied Don Quixote, “but few they who deserve
the name of knights.”
</p>
<p>
With these, and other discussions of the same sort, they passed that night
and the following day, without anything worth mention happening to them,
whereat Don Quixote was not a little dejected; but at length the next day,
at daybreak, they descried the great city of El Toboso, at the sight of
which Don Quixote’s spirits rose and Sancho’s fell, for he did
not know Dulcinea’s house, nor in all his life had he ever seen her,
any more than his master; so that they were both uneasy, the one to see
her, the other at not having seen her, and Sancho was at a loss to know
what he was to do when his master sent him to El Toboso. In the end, Don
Quixote made up his mind to enter the city at nightfall, and they waited
until the time came among some oak trees that were near El Toboso; and
when the moment they had agreed upon arrived, they made their entrance
into the city, where something happened them that may fairly be called
something.
