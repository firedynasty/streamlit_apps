WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE WITH CERTAIN GOATHERDS

<p>
He was cordially welcomed by the goatherds, and Sancho, having as best he
could put up Rocinante and the ass, drew towards the fragrance that came
from some pieces of salted goat simmering in a pot on the fire; and though
he would have liked at once to try if they were ready to be transferred
from the pot to the stomach, he refrained from doing so as the goatherds
removed them from the fire, and laying sheepskins on the ground, quickly
spread their rude table, and with signs of hearty good-will invited them
both to share what they had. Round the skins six of the men belonging to
the fold seated themselves, having first with rough politeness pressed Don
Quixote to take a seat upon a trough which they placed for him upside
down. Don Quixote seated himself, and Sancho remained standing to serve
the cup, which was made of horn. Seeing him standing, his master said to
him:
</p>
<p>
“That thou mayest see, Sancho, the good that knight-errantry contains in
itself, and how those who fill any office in it are on the high road to be
speedily honoured and esteemed by the world, I desire that thou seat
thyself here at my side and in the company of these worthy people, and
that thou be one with me who am thy master and natural lord, and that thou
eat from my plate and drink from whatever I drink from; for the same may
be said of knight-errantry as of love, that it levels all.”
</p>
<p>
“Great thanks,” said Sancho, “but I may tell your worship that provided I
have enough to eat, I can eat it as well, or better, standing, and by
myself, than seated alongside of an emperor. And indeed, if the truth is
to be told, what I eat in my corner without form or fuss has much more
relish for me, even though it be bread and onions, than the turkeys of
those other tables where I am forced to chew slowly, drink little, wipe my
mouth every minute, and cannot sneeze or cough if I want or do other
things that are the privileges of liberty and solitude. So, señor, as for
these honours which your worship would put upon me as a servant and
follower of knight-errantry, exchange them for other things which may be
of more use and advantage to me; for these, though I fully acknowledge
them as received, I renounce from this moment to the end of the world.”
</p>
<p>
“For all that,” said Don Quixote, “thou must seat thyself, because him who
humbleth himself God exalteth;” and seizing him by the arm he forced him
to sit down beside himself.
</p>
<p>
The goatherds did not understand this jargon about squires and
knights-errant, and all they did was to eat in silence and stare at their
guests, who with great elegance and appetite were stowing away pieces as
big as one’s fist. The course of meat finished, they spread upon the
sheepskins a great heap of parched acorns, and with them they put down a
half cheese harder than if it had been made of mortar. All this while the
horn was not idle, for it went round so constantly, now full, now empty,
like the bucket of a water-wheel, that it soon drained one of the two
wine-skins that were in sight. When Don Quixote had quite appeased his
appetite he took up a handful of the acorns, and contemplating them
attentively delivered himself somewhat in this fashion:
</p>
<p>
“Happy the age, happy the time, to which the ancients gave the name of
golden, not because in that fortunate age the gold so coveted in this our
iron one was gained without toil, but because they that lived in it knew
not the two words “<i>mine</i>” and “<i>thine</i>”! In that blessed age all things were
in common; to win the daily food no labour was required of any save to
stretch forth his hand and gather it from the sturdy oaks that stood
generously inviting him with their sweet ripe fruit. The clear streams and
running brooks yielded their savoury limpid waters in noble abundance. The
busy and sagacious bees fixed their republic in the clefts of the rocks
and hollows of the trees, offering without usance the plenteous produce of
their fragrant toil to every hand. The mighty cork trees, unenforced save
of their own courtesy, shed the broad light bark that served at first to
roof the houses supported by rude stakes, a protection against the
inclemency of heaven alone. Then all was peace, all friendship, all
concord; as yet the dull share of the crooked plough had not dared to rend
and pierce the tender bowels of our first mother that without compulsion
yielded from every portion of her broad fertile bosom all that could
satisfy, sustain, and delight the children that then possessed her. Then
was it that the innocent and fair young shepherdess roamed from vale to
vale and hill to hill, with flowing locks, and no more garments than were
needful modestly to cover what modesty seeks and ever sought to hide. Nor
were their ornaments like those in use to-day, set off by Tyrian purple,
and silk tortured in endless fashions, but the wreathed leaves of the
green dock and ivy, wherewith they went as bravely and becomingly decked
as our Court dames with all the rare and far-fetched artifices that idle
curiosity has taught them. Then the love-thoughts of the heart clothed
themselves simply and naturally as the heart conceived them, nor sought to
commend themselves by forced and rambling verbiage. Fraud, deceit, or
malice had then not yet mingled with truth and sincerity. Justice held her
ground, undisturbed and unassailed by the efforts of favour and of
interest, that now so much impair, pervert, and beset her. Arbitrary law
had not yet established itself in the mind of the judge, for then there
was no cause to judge and no one to be judged. Maidens and modesty, as I
have said, wandered at will alone and unattended, without fear of insult
from lawlessness or libertine assault, and if they were undone it was of
their own will and pleasure. But now in this hateful age of ours not one
is safe, not though some new labyrinth like that of Crete conceal and
surround her; even there the pestilence of gallantry will make its way to
them through chinks or on the air by the zeal of its accursed importunity,
and, despite of all seclusion, lead them to ruin. In defence of these, as
time advanced and wickedness increased, the order of knights-errant was
instituted, to defend maidens, to protect widows and to succour the
orphans and the needy. To this order I belong, brother goatherds, to whom
I return thanks for the hospitality and kindly welcome ye offer me and my
squire; for though by natural law all living are bound to show favour to
knights-errant, yet, seeing that without knowing this obligation ye have
welcomed and feasted me, it is right that with all the good-will in my
power I should thank you for yours.”
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
All this long harangue (which might very well have been spared) our knight
delivered because the acorns they gave him reminded him of the golden age;
and the whim seized him to address all this unnecessary argument to the
goatherds, who listened to him gaping in amazement without saying a word
in reply. Sancho likewise held his peace and ate acorns, and paid repeated
visits to the second wine-skin, which they had hung up on a cork tree to
keep the wine cool.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote was longer in talking than the supper in finishing, at the end
of which one of the goatherds said, “That your worship, señor
knight-errant, may say with more truth that we show you hospitality with
ready good-will, we will give you amusement and pleasure by making one of
our comrades sing: he will be here before long, and he is a very
intelligent youth and deep in love, and what is more he can read and write
and play on the rebeck to perfection.”
</p>
<p>
The goatherd had hardly done speaking, when the notes of the rebeck
reached their ears; and shortly after, the player came up, a very
good-looking young man of about two-and-twenty. His comrades asked him if
he had supped, and on his replying that he had, he who had already made
the offer said to him:
</p>
<p>
“In that case, Antonio, thou mayest as well do us the pleasure of singing
a little, that the gentleman, our guest, may see that even in the
mountains and woods there are musicians: we have told him of thy
accomplishments, and we want thee to show them and prove that we say true;
so, as thou livest, pray sit down and sing that ballad about thy love that
thy uncle the prebendary made thee, and that was so much liked in the
town.”
</p>
<p>
“With all my heart,” said the young man, and without waiting for more
pressing he seated himself on the trunk of a felled oak, and tuning his
rebeck, presently began to sing to these words.
</p>
<p class="poem">
ANTONIO’S BALLAD<br>
<br>
Thou dost love me well, Olalla;<br>
Well I know it, even though<br>
Love’s mute tongues, thine eyes, have never<br>
By their glances told me so.<br>
<br>
For I know my love thou knowest,<br>
Therefore thine to claim I dare:<br>
Once it ceases to be secret,<br>
Love need never feel despair.<br>
<br>
True it is, Olalla, sometimes<br>
Thou hast all too plainly shown<br>
That thy heart is brass in hardness,<br>
And thy snowy bosom stone.<br>
<br>
Yet for all that, in thy coyness,<br>
And thy fickle fits between,<br>
Hope is there—at least the border<br>
Of her garment may be seen.<br>
<br>
Lures to faith are they, those glimpses,<br>
And to faith in thee I hold;<br>
Kindness cannot make it stronger,<br>
Coldness cannot make it cold.<br>
<br>
If it be that love is gentle,<br>
In thy gentleness I see<br>
Something holding out assurance<br>
To the hope of winning thee.<br>
<br>
If it be that in devotion<br>
Lies a power hearts to move,<br>
That which every day I show thee,<br>
Helpful to my suit should prove.<br>
<br>
Many a time thou must have noticed—<br>
If to notice thou dost care—<br>
How I go about on Monday<br>
Dressed in all my Sunday wear.<br>
<br>
Love’s eyes love to look on brightness;<br>
Love loves what is gaily drest;<br>
Sunday, Monday, all I care is<br>
Thou shouldst see me in my best.<br>
<br>
No account I make of dances,<br>
Or of strains that pleased thee so,<br>
Keeping thee awake from midnight<br>
Till the cocks began to crow;<br>
<br>
Or of how I roundly swore it<br>
That there’s none so fair as thou;<br>
True it is, but as I said it,<br>
By the girls I’m hated now.<br>
<br>
For Teresa of the hillside<br>
At my praise of thee was sore;<br>
Said, “You think you love an angel;<br>
It’s a monkey you adore;<br>
<br>
“Caught by all her glittering trinkets,<br>
And her borrowed braids of hair,<br>
And a host of made-up beauties<br>
That would Love himself ensnare.”<br>
<br>
’Twas a lie, and so I told her,<br>
And her cousin at the word<br>
Gave me his defiance for it;<br>
And what followed thou hast heard.<br>
<br>
Mine is no high-flown affection,<br>
Mine no passion <i>par amours</i>—<br>
As they call it—what I offer<br>
Is an honest love, and pure.<br>
<br>
Cunning cords the holy Church has,<br>
Cords of softest silk they be;<br>
Put thy neck beneath the yoke, dear;<br>
Mine will follow, thou wilt see.<br>
<br>
Else—and once for all I swear it<br>
By the saint of most renown—<br>
If I ever quit the mountains,<br>
’Twill be in a friar’s gown.<br>
</p>
<p>
Here the goatherd brought his song to an end, and though Don Quixote
entreated him to sing more, Sancho had no mind that way, being more
inclined for sleep than for listening to songs; so said he to his master,
“Your worship will do well to settle at once where you mean to pass the
night, for the labour these good men are at all day does not allow them to
spend the night in singing.”
</p>
<p>
“I understand thee, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote; “I perceive clearly that
those visits to the wine-skin demand compensation in sleep rather than in
music.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s sweet to us all, blessed be God,” said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“I do not deny it,” replied Don Quixote; “but settle thyself where thou
wilt; those of my calling are more becomingly employed in watching than in
sleeping; still it would be as well if thou wert to dress this ear for me
again, for it is giving me more pain than it need.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho did as he bade him, but one of the goatherds, seeing the wound,
told him not to be uneasy, as he would apply a remedy with which it would
be soon healed; and gathering some leaves of rosemary, of which there was
a great quantity there, he chewed them and mixed them with a little salt,
and applying them to the ear he secured them firmly with a bandage,
assuring him that no other treatment would be required, and so it proved.
