OF THE QUARREL THAT DON QUIXOTE HAD WITH THE GOATHERD, TOGETHER WITH THE

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
The goatherd’s tale gave great satisfaction to all the hearers, and the
canon especially enjoyed it, for he had remarked with particular attention
the manner in which it had been told, which was as unlike the manner of a
clownish goatherd as it was like that of a polished city wit; and he
observed that the curate had been quite right in saying that the woods
bred men of learning. They all offered their services to Eugenio but he
who showed himself most liberal in this way was Don Quixote, who said to
him, “Most assuredly, brother goatherd, if I found myself in a position to
attempt any adventure, I would, this very instant, set out on your behalf,
and would rescue Leandra from that convent (where no doubt she is kept
against her will), in spite of the abbess and all who might try to prevent
me, and would place her in your hands to deal with her according to your
will and pleasure, observing, however, the laws of chivalry which lay down
that no violence of any kind is to be offered to any damsel. But I trust
in God our Lord that the might of one malignant enchanter may not prove so
great but that the power of another better disposed may prove superior to
it, and then I promise you my support and assistance, as I am bound to do
by my profession, which is none other than to give aid to the weak and
needy.”
</p>
<p>
The goatherd eyed him, and noticing Don Quixote’s sorry appearance and
looks, he was filled with wonder, and asked the barber, who was next him,
“Señor, who is this man who makes such a figure and talks in such a
strain?”
</p>
<p>
“Who should it be,” said the barber, “but the famous Don Quixote of La
Mancha, the undoer of injustice, the righter of wrongs, the protector of
damsels, the terror of giants, and the winner of battles?”
</p>
<p>
“That,” said the goatherd, “sounds like what one reads in the books of the
knights-errant, who did all that you say this man does; though it is my
belief that either you are joking, or else this gentleman has empty
lodgings in his head.”
</p>
<p>
“You are a great scoundrel,” said Don Quixote, “and it is you who are
empty and a fool. I am fuller than ever was the whoreson bitch that bore
you;” and passing from words to deeds, he caught up a loaf that was near
him and sent it full in the goatherd’s face, with such force that he
flattened his nose; but the goatherd, who did not understand jokes, and
found himself roughly handled in such good earnest, paying no respect to
carpet, tablecloth, or diners, sprang upon Don Quixote, and seizing him by
the throat with both hands would no doubt have throttled him, had not
Sancho Panza that instant come to the rescue, and grasping him by the
shoulders flung him down on the table, smashing plates, breaking glasses,
and upsetting and scattering everything on it. Don Quixote, finding
himself free, strove to get on top of the goatherd, who, with his face
covered with blood, and soundly kicked by Sancho, was on all fours feeling
about for one of the table-knives to take a bloody revenge with. The canon
and the curate, however, prevented him, but the barber so contrived it
that he got Don Quixote under him, and rained down upon him such a shower
of fisticuffs that the poor knight’s face streamed with blood as freely as
his own. The canon and the curate were bursting with laughter, the
officers were capering with delight, and both the one and the other hissed
them on as they do dogs that are worrying one another in a fight. Sancho
alone was frantic, for he could not free himself from the grasp of one of
the canon’s servants, who kept him from going to his master’s assistance.

<p>
At last, while they were all, with the exception of the two bruisers who
were mauling each other, in high glee and enjoyment, they heard a trumpet
sound a note so doleful that it made them all look in the direction whence
the sound seemed to come. But the one that was most excited by hearing it
was Don Quixote, who though sorely against his will he was under the
goatherd, and something more than pretty well pummelled, said to him,
“Brother devil (for it is impossible but that thou must be one since thou
hast had might and strength enough to overcome mine), I ask thee to agree
to a truce for but one hour for the solemn note of yonder trumpet that
falls on our ears seems to me to summon me to some new adventure.” The
goatherd, who was by this time tired of pummelling and being pummelled,
released him at once, and Don Quixote rising to his feet and turning his
eyes to the quarter where the sound had been heard, suddenly saw coming
down the slope of a hill several men clad in white like penitents.
</p>
<p>
The fact was that the clouds had that year withheld their moisture from
the earth, and in all the villages of the district they were organising
processions, rogations, and penances, imploring God to open the hands of
his mercy and send the rain; and to this end the people of a village that
was hard by were going in procession to a holy hermitage there was on one
side of that valley. Don Quixote when he saw the strange garb of the
penitents, without reflecting how often he had seen it before, took it
into his head that this was a case of adventure, and that it fell to him
alone as a knight-errant to engage in it; and he was all the more
confirmed in this notion, by the idea that an image draped in black they
had with them was some illustrious lady that these villains and
discourteous thieves were carrying off by force. As soon as this occurred
to him he ran with all speed to Rocinante who was grazing at large, and
taking the bridle and the buckler from the saddle-bow, he had him bridled
in an instant, and calling to Sancho for his sword he mounted Rocinante,
braced his buckler on his arm, and in a loud voice exclaimed to those who
stood by, “Now, noble company, ye shall see how important it is that there
should be knights in the world professing the order of knight-errantry; now, I
say, ye shall see, by the deliverance of that worthy lady who is borne
captive there, whether knights-errant deserve to be held in estimation,”
and so saying he brought his legs to bear on Rocinante—for he had no
spurs—and at a full canter (for in all this veracious history we
never read of Rocinante fairly galloping) set off to encounter the
penitents, though the curate, the canon, and the barber ran to prevent
him. But it was out of their power, nor did he even stop for the shouts of
Sancho calling after him, “Where are you going, Señor Don Quixote? What
devils have possessed you to set you on against our Catholic faith? Plague
take me! mind, that is a procession of penitents, and the lady they are
carrying on that stand there is the blessed image of the immaculate
Virgin. Take care what you are doing, señor, for this time it may be
safely said you don’t know what you are about.” Sancho laboured in vain,
for his master was so bent on coming to quarters with these sheeted
figures and releasing the lady in black that he did not hear a word; and
even had he heard, he would not have turned back if the king had ordered
him. He came up with the procession and reined in Rocinante, who was
already anxious enough to slacken speed a little, and in a hoarse, excited
voice he exclaimed, “You who hide your faces, perhaps because you are not
good subjects, pay attention and listen to what I am about to say to you.”
The first to halt were those who were carrying the image, and one of the
four ecclesiastics who were chanting the Litany, struck by the strange
figure of Don Quixote, the leanness of Rocinante, and the other ludicrous
peculiarities he observed, said in reply to him, “Brother, if you have
anything to say to us say it quickly, for these brethren are whipping
themselves, and we cannot stop, nor is it reasonable we should stop to
hear anything, unless indeed it is short enough to be said in two words.”
</p>
<p>
“I will say it in one,” replied Don Quixote, “and it is this; that at
once, this very instant, ye release that fair lady whose tears and sad
aspect show plainly that ye are carrying her off against her will, and
that ye have committed some scandalous outrage against her; and I, who was
born into the world to redress all such like wrongs, will not permit you
to advance another step until you have restored to her the liberty she
pines for and deserves.”
</p>
<p>
From these words all the hearers concluded that he must be a madman, and
began to laugh heartily, and their laughter acted like gunpowder on Don
Quixote’s fury, for drawing his sword without another word he made a rush
at the stand. One of those who supported it, leaving the burden to his
comrades, advanced to meet him, flourishing a forked stick that he had for
propping up the stand when resting, and with this he caught a mighty cut
Don Quixote made at him that severed it in two; but with the portion that
remained in his hand he dealt such a thwack on the shoulder of Don
Quixote’s sword arm (which the buckler could not protect against the
clownish assault) that poor Don Quixote came to the ground in a sad
plight.
</p>
<p>
Sancho Panza, who was coming on close behind puffing and blowing, seeing
him fall, cried out to his assailant not to strike him again, for he was a
poor enchanted knight, who had never harmed anyone all the days of his
life; but what checked the clown was, not Sancho’s shouting, but seeing
that Don Quixote did not stir hand or foot; and so, fancying he had killed
him, he hastily hitched up his tunic under his girdle and took to his
heels across the country like a deer.
</p>
<p>
By this time all Don Quixote’s companions had come up to where he lay; but
the processionists seeing them come running, and with them the officers of
the Brotherhood with their crossbows, apprehended mischief, and clustering
round the image, raised their hoods, and grasped their scourges, as the
priests did their tapers, and awaited the attack, resolved to defend
themselves and even to take the offensive against their assailants if they
could. Fortune, however, arranged the matter better than they expected,
for all Sancho did was to fling himself on his master’s body, raising over
him the most doleful and laughable lamentation that ever was heard, for he
believed he was dead. The curate was known to another curate who walked in
the procession, and their recognition of one another set at rest the
apprehensions of both parties; the first then told the other in two words
who Don Quixote was, and he and the whole troop of penitents went to see
if the poor gentleman was dead, and heard Sancho Panza saying, with tears
in his eyes, “Oh flower of chivalry, that with one blow of a stick hast
ended the course of thy well-spent life! Oh pride of thy race, honour and
glory of all La Mancha, nay, of all the world, that for want of thee will
be full of evil-doers, no longer in fear of punishment for their misdeeds!
Oh thou, generous above all the Alexanders, since for only eight months of
service thou hast given me the best island the sea girds or surrounds!
Humble with the proud, haughty with the humble, encounterer of dangers,
endurer of outrages, enamoured without reason, imitator of the good,
scourge of the wicked, enemy of the mean, in short, knight-errant, which
is all that can be said!”
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
At the cries and moans of Sancho, Don Quixote came to himself, and the
first word he said was, “He who lives separated from you, sweetest
Dulcinea, has greater miseries to endure than these. Aid me, friend
Sancho, to mount the enchanted cart, for I am not in a condition to press
the saddle of Rocinante, as this shoulder is all knocked to pieces.”
</p>
<p>
“That I will do with all my heart, señor,” said Sancho; “and let us return
to our village with these gentlemen, who seek your good, and there we will
prepare for making another sally, which may turn out more profitable and
creditable to us.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou art right, Sancho,” returned Don Quixote; “It will be wise to let
the malign influence of the stars which now prevails pass off.”
</p>
<p>
The canon, the curate, and the barber told him he would act very wisely in
doing as he said; and so, highly amused at Sancho Panza’s simplicities,
they placed Don Quixote in the cart as before. The procession once more
formed itself in order and proceeded on its road; the goatherd took his
leave of the party; the officers of the Brotherhood declined to go any
farther, and the curate paid them what was due to them; the canon begged
the curate to let him know how Don Quixote did, whether he was cured of
his madness or still suffered from it, and then begged leave to continue
his journey; in short, they all separated and went their ways, leaving to
themselves the curate and the barber, Don Quixote, Sancho Panza, and the
good Rocinante, who regarded everything with as great resignation as his
master. The carter yoked his oxen and made Don Quixote comfortable on a
truss of hay, and at his usual deliberate pace took the road the curate
directed, and at the end of six days they reached Don Quixote’s village,
and entered it about the middle of the day, which it so happened was a
Sunday, and the people were all in the plaza, through which Don Quixote’s
cart passed. They all flocked to see what was in the cart, and when they
recognised their townsman they were filled with amazement, and a boy ran
off to bring the news to his housekeeper and his niece that their master
and uncle had come back all lean and yellow and stretched on a truss of
hay on an ox-cart. It was piteous to hear the cries the two good ladies
raised, how they beat their breasts and poured out fresh maledictions on
those accursed books of chivalry; all which was renewed when they saw Don
Quixote coming in at the gate.
</p>
<p>
At the news of Don Quixote’s arrival Sancho Panza’s wife came running, for
she by this time knew that her husband had gone away with him as his
squire, and on seeing Sancho, the first thing she asked him was if the ass
was well. Sancho replied that he was, better than his master was.
</p>
<p>
“Thanks be to God,” said she, “for being so good to me; but now tell me,
my friend, what have you made by your squirings? What gown have you
brought me back? What shoes for your children?”
</p>
<p>
“I bring nothing of that sort, wife,” said Sancho; “though I bring other
things of more consequence and value.”
</p>
<p>
“I am very glad of that,” returned his wife; “show me these things of more
value and consequence, my friend; for I want to see them to cheer my heart
that has been so sad and heavy all these ages that you have been away.”
</p>
<p>
“I will show them to you at home, wife,” said Sancho; “be content for the
present; for if it please God that we should again go on our travels in
search of adventures, you will soon see me a count, or governor of an
island, and that not one of those everyday ones, but the best that is to
be had.”
</p>
<p>
“Heaven grant it, husband,” said she, “for indeed we have need of it. But
tell me, what’s this about islands, for I don’t understand it?”
</p>
<p>
“Honey is not for the mouth of the ass,” returned Sancho; “all in good
time thou shalt see, wife—nay, thou wilt be surprised to hear
thyself called ‘your ladyship’ by all thy vassals.”
</p>
<p>
“What are you talking about, Sancho, with your ladyships, islands, and
vassals?” returned Teresa Panza—for so Sancho’s wife was called,
though they were not relations, for in La Mancha it is customary for wives
to take their husbands’ surnames.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be in such a hurry to know all this, Teresa,” said Sancho; “it is
enough that I am telling you the truth, so shut your mouth. But I may tell
you this much by the way, that there is nothing in the world more
delightful than to be a person of consideration, squire to a
knight-errant, and a seeker of adventures. To be sure most of those one
finds do not end as pleasantly as one could wish, for out of a hundred,
ninety-nine will turn out cross and contrary. I know it by experience, for
out of some I came blanketed, and out of others belaboured. Still, for all
that, it is a fine thing to be on the look-out for what may happen,
crossing mountains, searching woods, climbing rocks, visiting castles,
putting up at inns, all at free quarters, and devil take the maravedi to
pay.”
</p>
<p>
While this conversation passed between Sancho Panza and his wife, Don
Quixote’s housekeeper and niece took him in and undressed him and laid him
in his old bed. He eyed them askance, and could not make out where he was.
The curate charged his niece to be very careful to make her uncle
comfortable and to keep a watch over him lest he should make his escape
from them again, telling her what they had been obliged to do to bring him
home. On this the pair once more lifted up their voices and renewed their
maledictions upon the books of chivalry, and implored heaven to plunge the
authors of such lies and nonsense into the midst of the bottomless pit.
They were, in short, kept in anxiety and dread lest their uncle and master
should give them the slip the moment he found himself somewhat better, and
as they feared so it fell out.
</p>
<p>
But the author of this history, though he has devoted research and
industry to the discovery of the deeds achieved by Don Quixote in his
third sally, has been unable to obtain any information respecting them, at
any rate derived from authentic documents; tradition has merely preserved
in the memory of La Mancha the fact that Don Quixote, the third time he
sallied forth from his home, betook himself to Saragossa, where he was
present at some famous jousts which came off in that city, and that he had
adventures there worthy of his valour and high intelligence. Of his end
and death he could learn no particulars, nor would he have ascertained it
or known of it, if good fortune had not produced an old physician for him
who had in his possession a leaden box, which, according to his account,
had been discovered among the crumbling foundations of an ancient
hermitage that was being rebuilt; in which box were found certain
parchment manuscripts in Gothic character, but in Castilian verse,
containing many of his achievements, and setting forth the beauty of
Dulcinea, the form of Rocinante, the fidelity of Sancho Panza, and the
burial of Don Quixote himself, together with sundry epitaphs and eulogies
on his life and character; but all that could be read and deciphered were
those which the trustworthy author of this new and unparalleled history
here presents. And the said author asks of those that shall read it
nothing in return for the vast toil which it has cost him in examining and
searching the Manchegan archives in order to bring it to light, save that
they give him the same credit that people of sense give to the books of
chivalry that pervade the world and are so popular; for with this he will
consider himself amply paid and fully satisfied, and will be encouraged to
seek out and produce other histories, if not as truthful, at least equal
in invention and not less entertaining. The first words written on the
parchment found in the leaden box were these:

<h3>DEDICATION OF VOLUME II.</h3>
<p>
<br><br>
</p>
<h3>TO THE COUNT OF LEMOS:</h3>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
These days past, when sending Your Excellency my plays, that had appeared
in print before being shown on the stage, I said, if I remember well, that
Don Quixote was putting on his spurs to go and render homage to Your
Excellency. Now I say that “with his spurs, he is on his way.”
Should he reach destination methinks I shall have rendered some service to
Your Excellency, as from many parts I am urged to send him off, so as to
dispel the loathing and disgust caused by another Don Quixote who, under
the name of Second Part, has run masquerading through the whole world. And
he who has shown the greatest longing for him has been the great Emperor
of China, who wrote me a letter in Chinese a month ago and sent it by a
special courier. He asked me, or to be truthful, he begged me to send him
Don Quixote, for he intended to found a college where the Spanish tongue
would be taught, and it was his wish that the book to be read should be
the History of Don Quixote. He also added that I should go and be the
rector of this college. I asked the bearer if His Majesty had afforded a
sum in aid of my travel expenses. He answered, “No, not even in
thought.”
</p>
<p>
“Then, brother,” I replied, “you can return to your
China, post haste or at whatever haste you are bound to go, as I am not
fit for so long a travel and, besides being ill, I am very much without
money, while Emperor for Emperor and Monarch for Monarch, I have at Naples
the great Count of Lemos, who, without so many petty titles of colleges
and rectorships, sustains me, protects me and does me more favour than I
can wish for.”
</p>
<p>
Thus I gave him his leave and I beg mine from you, offering Your
Excellency the “Trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda,” a book I
shall finish within four months, Deo volente, and which will be either the
worst or the best that has been composed in our language, I mean of those
intended for entertainment; at which I repent of having called it the
worst, for, in the opinion of friends, it is bound to attain the summit of
possible quality. May Your Excellency return in such health that is wished
you; Persiles will be ready to kiss your hand and I your feet, being as I
am, Your Excellency’s most humble servant.
</p>
<p>
From Madrid, this last day of October of the year one thousand six hundred
and fifteen.
</p>
<p>
At the service of Your Excellency:

<h3>THE AUTHOR’S PREFACE</h3>

<p>
God bless me, gentle (or it may be plebeian) reader, how eagerly must thou
be looking forward to this preface, expecting to find there retaliation,
scolding, and abuse against the author of the second Don Quixote—I
mean him who was, they say, begotten at Tordesillas and born at Tarragona!
Well then, the truth is, I am not going to give thee that satisfaction;
for, though injuries stir up anger in humbler breasts, in mine the rule
must admit of an exception. Thou wouldst have me call him ass, fool, and
malapert, but I have no such intention; let his offence be his punishment,
with his bread let him eat it, and there’s an end of it. What I
cannot help taking amiss is that he charges me with being old and
one-handed, as if it had been in my power to keep time from passing over
me, or as if the loss of my hand had been brought about in some tavern,
and not on the grandest occasion the past or present has seen, or the
future can hope to see. If my wounds have no beauty to the beholder’s
eye, they are, at least, honourable in the estimation of those who know
where they were received; for the soldier shows to greater advantage dead
in battle than alive in flight; and so strongly is this my feeling, that
if now it were proposed to perform an impossibility for me, I would rather
have had my share in that mighty action, than be free from my wounds this
minute without having been present at it. Those the soldier shows on his
face and breast are stars that direct others to the heaven of honour and
ambition of merited praise; and moreover it is to be observed that it is
not with grey hairs that one writes, but with the understanding, and that
commonly improves with years. I take it amiss, too, that he calls me
envious, and explains to me, as if I were ignorant, what envy is; for
really and truly, of the two kinds there are, I only know that which is
holy, noble, and high-minded; and if that be so, as it is, I am not likely
to attack a priest, above all if, in addition, he holds the rank of
familiar of the Holy Office. And if he said what he did on account of him
on whose behalf it seems he spoke, he is entirely mistaken; for I worship
the genius of that person, and admire his works and his unceasing and
strenuous industry. After all, I am grateful to this gentleman, the
author, for saying that my novels are more satirical than exemplary, but
that they are good; for they could not be that unless there was a little
of everything in them.
</p>
<p>
I suspect thou wilt say that I am taking a very humble line, and keeping
myself too much within the bounds of my moderation, from a feeling that
additional suffering should not be inflicted upon a sufferer, and that
what this gentleman has to endure must doubtless be very great, as he does
not dare to come out into the open field and broad daylight, but hides his
name and disguises his country as if he had been guilty of some lese
majesty. If perchance thou shouldst come to know him, tell him from me
that I do not hold myself aggrieved; for I know well what the temptations
of the devil are, and that one of the greatest is putting it into a man’s
head that he can write and print a book by which he will get as much fame
as money, and as much money as fame; and to prove it I will beg of you, in
your own sprightly, pleasant way, to tell him this story.
</p>
<p>
There was a madman in Seville who took to one of the drollest absurdities
and vagaries that ever madman in the world gave way to. It was this: he
made a tube of reed sharp at one end, and catching a dog in the street, or
wherever it might be, he with his foot held one of its legs fast, and with
his hand lifted up the other, and as best he could fixed the tube where,
by blowing, he made the dog as round as a ball; then holding it in this
position, he gave it a couple of slaps on the belly, and let it go, saying
to the bystanders (and there were always plenty of them): “Do your
worships think, now, that it is an easy thing to blow up a dog?”—Does
your worship think now, that it is an easy thing to write a book?
</p>
<p>
And if this story does not suit him, you may, dear reader, tell him this
one, which is likewise of a madman and a dog.
</p>
<p>
In Cordova there was another madman, whose way it was to carry a piece of
marble slab or a stone, not of the lightest, on his head, and when he came
upon any unwary dog he used to draw close to him and let the weight fall
right on top of him; on which the dog in a rage, barking and howling,
would run three streets without stopping. It so happened, however, that
one of the dogs he discharged his load upon was a cap-maker’s dog,
of which his master was very fond. The stone came down hitting it on the
head, the dog raised a yell at the blow, the master saw the affair and was
wroth, and snatching up a measuring-yard rushed out at the madman and did
not leave a sound bone in his body, and at every stroke he gave him he
said, “You dog, you thief! my lurcher! Don’t you see, you
brute, that my dog is a lurcher?” and so, repeating the word “lurcher”
again and again, he sent the madman away beaten to a jelly. The madman
took the lesson to heart, and vanished, and for more than a month never
once showed himself in public; but after that he came out again with his
old trick and a heavier load than ever. He came up to where there was a
dog, and examining it very carefully without venturing to let the stone
fall, he said: “This is a lurcher; ware!” In short, all the
dogs he came across, be they mastiffs or terriers, he said were lurchers;
and he discharged no more stones. Maybe it will be the same with this
historian; that he will not venture another time to discharge the weight
of his wit in books, which, being bad, are harder than stones. Tell him,
too, that I do not care a farthing for the threat he holds out to me of
depriving me of my profit by means of his book; for, to borrow from the
famous interlude of “The Perendenga,” I say in answer to him,
“Long life to my lord the Veintiquatro, and Christ be with us all.”
Long life to the great Conde de Lemos, whose Christian charity and
well-known generosity support me against all the strokes of my curst
fortune; and long life to the supreme benevolence of His Eminence of
Toledo, Don Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas; and what matter if there be no
printing-presses in the world, or if they print more books against me than
there are letters in the verses of Mingo Revulgo! These two princes,
unsought by any adulation or flattery of mine, of their own goodness
alone, have taken it upon them to show me kindness and protect me, and in
this I consider myself happier and richer than if Fortune had raised me to
her greatest height in the ordinary way. The poor man may retain honour,
but not the vicious; poverty may cast a cloud over nobility, but cannot
hide it altogether; and as virtue of itself sheds a certain light, even
though it be through the straits and chinks of penury, it wins the esteem
of lofty and noble spirits, and in consequence their protection. Thou
needst say no more to him, nor will I say anything more to thee, save to
tell thee to bear in mind that this Second Part of “Don Quixote”
which I offer thee is cut by the same craftsman and from the same cloth as
the First, and that in it I present thee Don Quixote continued, and at
length dead and buried, so that no one may dare to bring forward any
further evidence against him, for that already produced is sufficient; and
suffice it, too, that some reputable person should have given an account
of all these shrewd lunacies of his without going into the matter again;
for abundance, even of good things, prevents them from being valued; and
scarcity, even in the case of what is bad, confers a certain value. I was
forgetting to tell thee that thou mayest expect the “Persiles,”
which I am now finishing, and also the Second Part of “Galatea.”
