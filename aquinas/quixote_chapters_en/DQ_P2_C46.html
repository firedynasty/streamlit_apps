<a id="ch46b"></a>CHAPTER XLVI.<br>
OF THE TERRIBLE BELL AND CAT FRIGHT THAT DON QUIXOTE GOT IN THE COURSE OF
THE ENAMOURED ALTISIDORA’S WOOING

<p>
We left Don Quixote wrapped up in the reflections which the music of the
enamourned maid Altisidora had given rise to. He went to bed with them,
and just like fleas they would not let him sleep or get a moment’s
rest, and the broken stitches of his stockings helped them. But as Time is
fleet and no obstacle can stay his course, he came riding on the hours,
and morning very soon arrived. Seeing which Don Quixote quitted the soft
down, and, nowise slothful, dressed himself in his chamois suit and put on
his travelling boots to hide the disaster to his stockings. He threw over
him his scarlet mantle, put on his head a montera of green velvet trimmed
with silver edging, flung across his shoulder the baldric with his good
trenchant sword, took up a large rosary that he always carried with him,
and with great solemnity and precision of gait proceeded to the
antechamber where the duke and duchess were already dressed and waiting
for him. But as he passed through a gallery, Altisidora and the other
damsel, her friend, were lying in wait for him, and the instant Altisidora
saw him she pretended to faint, while her friend caught her in her lap,
and began hastily unlacing the bosom of her dress.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote observed it, and approaching them said, “I know very
well what this seizure arises from.”
</p>
<p>
“I know not from what,” replied the friend, “for
Altisidora is the healthiest damsel in all this house, and I have never
heard her complain all the time I have known her. A plague on all the
knights-errant in the world, if they be all ungrateful! Go away, Señor Don
Quixote; for this poor child will not come to herself again so long as you
are here.”
</p>

</p>
<p>
To which Don Quixote returned, “Do me the favour, señora, to let a
lute be placed in my chamber to-night; and I will comfort this poor maiden
to the best of my power; for in the early stages of love a prompt
disillusion is an approved remedy;” and with this he retired, so as
not to be remarked by any who might see him there.
</p>
<p>
He had scarcely withdrawn when Altisidora, recovering from her swoon, said
to her companion, “The lute must be left, for no doubt Don Quixote
intends to give us some music; and being his it will not be bad.”
</p>
<p>
They went at once to inform the duchess of what was going on, and of the
lute Don Quixote asked for, and she, delighted beyond measure, plotted
with the duke and her two damsels to play him a trick that should be
amusing but harmless; and in high glee they waited for night, which came
quickly as the day had come; and as for the day, the duke and duchess
spent it in charming conversation with Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
When eleven o’clock came, Don Quixote found a guitar in his chamber;
he tried it, opened the window, and perceived that some persons were
walking in the garden; and having passed his fingers over the frets of the
guitar and tuned it as well as he could, he spat and cleared his chest,
and then with a voice a little hoarse but full-toned, he sang the
following ballad, which he had himself that day composed:
</p>
<p class="poem">
Mighty Love the hearts of maidens<br>
Doth unsettle and perplex,<br>
And the instrument he uses<br>
Most of all is idleness.<br>
<br>
Sewing, stitching, any labour,<br>
Having always work to do,<br>
To the poison Love instilleth<br>
Is the antidote most sure.<br>
<br>
And to proper-minded maidens<br>
Who desire the matron’s name<br>
Modesty’s a marriage portion,<br>
Modesty their highest praise.<br>
<br>
Men of prudence and discretion,<br>
Courtiers gay and gallant knights,<br>
With the wanton damsels dally,<br>
But the modest take to wife.<br>
There are passions, transient, fleeting,<br>
Loves in hostelries declar’d,<br>
Sunrise loves, with sunset ended,<br>
When the guest hath gone his way.<br>
<br>
Love that springs up swift and sudden,<br>
Here to-day, to-morrow flown,<br>
Passes, leaves no trace behind it,<br>
Leaves no image on the soul.<br>
<br>
Painting that is laid on painting<br>
Maketh no display or show;<br>
Where one beauty’s in possession<br>
There no other can take hold.<br>
<br>
Dulcinea del Toboso<br>
Painted on my heart I wear;<br>
Never from its tablets, never,<br>
Can her image be eras’d.<br>
<br>
The quality of all in lovers<br>
Most esteemed is constancy;<br>
’Tis by this that love works wonders,<br>
This exalts them to the skies.<br>
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote had got so far with his song, to which the duke, the duchess,
Altisidora, and nearly the whole household of the castle were listening,
when all of a sudden from a gallery above that was exactly over his window
they let down a cord with more than a hundred bells attached to it, and
immediately after that discharged a great sack full of cats, which also
had bells of smaller size tied to their tails. Such was the din of the
bells and the squalling of the cats, that though the duke and duchess were
the contrivers of the joke they were startled by it, while Don Quixote
stood paralysed with fear; and as luck would have it, two or three of the
cats made their way in through the grating of his chamber, and flying from
one side to the other, made it seem as if there was a legion of devils at
large in it. They extinguished the candles that were burning in the room,
and rushed about seeking some way of escape; the cord with the large bells
never ceased rising and falling; and most of the people of the castle, not
knowing what was really the matter, were at their wits’ end with
astonishment. Don Quixote sprang to his feet, and drawing his sword, began
making passes at the grating, shouting out, “Avaunt, malignant
enchanters! avaunt, ye witchcraft-working rabble! I am Don Quixote of La
Mancha, against whom your evil machinations avail not nor have any power.”
And turning upon the cats that were running about the room, he made
several cuts at them. They dashed at the grating and escaped by it, save
one that, finding itself hard pressed by the slashes of Don Quixote’s
sword, flew at his face and held on to his nose tooth and nail, with the
pain of which he began to shout his loudest. The duke and duchess hearing
this, and guessing what it was, ran with all haste to his room, and as the
poor gentleman was striving with all his might to detach the cat from his
face, they opened the door with a master-key and went in with lights and
witnessed the unequal combat. The duke ran forward to part the combatants,
but Don Quixote cried out aloud, “Let no one take him from me; leave
me hand to hand with this demon, this wizard, this enchanter; I will teach
him, I myself, who Don Quixote of La Mancha is.” The cat, however,
never minding these threats, snarled and held on; but at last the duke
pulled it off and flung it out of the window. Don Quixote was left with a
face as full of holes as a sieve and a nose not in very good condition,
and greatly vexed that they did not let him finish the battle he had been
so stoutly fighting with that villain of an enchanter. They sent for some
oil of John’s wort, and Altisidora herself with her own fair hands
bandaged all the wounded parts; and as she did so she said to him in a low
voice. “All these mishaps have befallen thee, hardhearted knight,
for the sin of thy insensibility and obstinacy; and God grant thy squire
Sancho may forget to whip himself, so that that dearly beloved Dulcinea of
thine may never be released from her enchantment, that thou mayest never
come to her bed, at least while I who adore thee am alive.”
</p>
<p>
To all this Don Quixote made no answer except to heave deep sighs, and
then stretched himself on his bed, thanking the duke and duchess for their
kindness, not because he stood in any fear of that bell-ringing rabble of
enchanters in cat shape, but because he recognised their good intentions
in coming to his rescue. The duke and duchess left him to repose and
withdrew greatly grieved at the unfortunate result of the joke; as they
never thought the adventure would have fallen so heavy on Don Quixote or
cost him so dear, for it cost him five days of confinement to his bed,
during which he had another adventure, pleasanter than the late one, which
his chronicler will not relate just now in order that he may turn his
attention to Sancho Panza, who was proceeding with great diligence and
drollery in his government.
