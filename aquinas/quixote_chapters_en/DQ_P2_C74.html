OF HOW DON QUIXOTE FELL SICK, AND OF THE WILL HE MADE, AND HOW HE DIED

</p>
<p>
As nothing that is man’s can last for ever, but all tends ever
downwards from its beginning to its end, and above all man’s life,
and as Don Quixote’s enjoyed no special dispensation from heaven to
stay its course, its end and close came when he least looked for it.
For—whether it was of the dejection the thought of his defeat produced,
or of heaven’s will that so ordered it—a fever settled upon him and
kept him in his bed for six days, during which he was often visited by his
friends the curate, the bachelor, and the barber, while his good squire
Sancho Panza never quitted his bedside. They, persuaded that it was grief
at finding himself vanquished, and the object of his heart, the liberation
and disenchantment of Dulcinea, unattained, that kept him in this state,
strove by all the means in their power to cheer him up; the bachelor
bidding him take heart and get up to begin his pastoral life, for which he
himself, he said, had already composed an eclogue that would take the
shine out of all Sannazaro had ever written, and had bought with his own
money two famous dogs to guard the flock, one called Barcino and the other
Butron, which a herdsman of Quintanar had sold him.
</p>
<p>
But for all this Don Quixote could not shake off his sadness. His friends
called in the doctor, who felt his pulse and was not very well satisfied
with it, and said that in any case it would be well for him to attend to
the health of his soul, as that of his body was in a bad way. Don Quixote
heard this calmly; but not so his housekeeper, his niece, and his squire,
who fell weeping bitterly, as if they had him lying dead before them. The
doctor’s opinion was that melancholy and depression were bringing
him to his end. Don Quixote begged them to leave him to himself, as he had
a wish to sleep a little. They obeyed, and he slept at one stretch, as the
saying is, more than six hours, so that the housekeeper and niece thought
he was going to sleep for ever. But at the end of that time he woke up,
and in a loud voice exclaimed, “Blessed be Almighty God, who has
shown me such goodness. In truth his mercies are boundless, and the sins
of men can neither limit them nor keep them back!”
</p>
<p>
The niece listened with attention to her uncle’s words, and they
struck her as more coherent than what usually fell from him, at least
during his illness, so she asked, “What are you saying, señor? Has
anything strange occurred? What mercies or what sins of men are you
talking of?”
</p>
<p>
“The mercies, niece,” said Don Quixote, “are those that
God has this moment shown me, and with him, as I said, my sins are no
impediment to them. My reason is now free and clear, rid of the dark
shadows of ignorance that my unhappy constant study of those detestable
books of chivalry cast over it. Now I see through their absurdities and
deceptions, and it only grieves me that this destruction of my illusions
has come so late that it leaves me no time to make some amends by reading
other books that might be a light to my soul. Niece, I feel myself at the
point of death, and I would fain meet it in such a way as to show that my
life has not been so ill that I should leave behind me the name of a
madman; for though I have been one, I would not that the fact should be
made plainer at my death. Call in to me, my dear, my good friends the
curate, the bachelor Samson Carrasco, and Master Nicholas the barber, for
I wish to confess and make my will.” But his niece was saved the
trouble by the entrance of the three. The instant Don Quixote saw them he
exclaimed, “Good news for you, good sirs, that I am no longer Don
Quixote of La Mancha, but Alonso Quixano, whose way of life won for him
the name of Good. Now am I the enemy of Amadis of Gaul and of the whole
countless troop of his descendants; odious to me now are all the profane
stories of knight-errantry; now I perceive my folly, and the peril into
which reading them brought me; now, by God’s mercy schooled into my
right senses, I loathe them.”
</p>
<p>
When the three heard him speak in this way, they had no doubt whatever
that some new craze had taken possession of him; and said Samson, “What?
Señor Don Quixote! Now that we have intelligence of the lady Dulcinea
being disenchanted, are you taking this line; now, just as we are on the
point of becoming shepherds, to pass our lives singing, like princes, are
you thinking of turning hermit? Hush, for heaven’s sake, be rational
and let’s have no more nonsense.”
</p>
<p>
“All that nonsense,” said Don Quixote, “that until now
has been a reality to my hurt, my death will, with heaven’s help,
turn to my good. I feel, sirs, that I am rapidly drawing near death; a
truce to jesting; let me have a confessor to confess me, and a notary to
make my will; for in extremities like this, man must not trifle with his
soul; and while the curate is confessing me let someone, I beg, go for
the notary.”
</p>
<p>
They looked at one another, wondering at Don Quixote’s words; but,
though uncertain, they were inclined to believe him, and one of the signs
by which they came to the conclusion he was dying was this so sudden and
complete return to his senses after having been mad; for to the words
already quoted he added much more, so well expressed, so devout, and so
rational, as to banish all doubt and convince them that he was sound of
mind. The curate turned them all out, and left alone with him confessed
him. The bachelor went for the notary and returned shortly afterwards with
him and with Sancho, who, having already learned from the bachelor the
condition his master was in, and finding the housekeeper and niece
weeping, began to blubber and shed tears.
</p>
<p>
The confession over, the curate came out saying, “Alonso Quixano the
Good is indeed dying, and is indeed in his right mind; we may now go in to
him while he makes his will.”
</p>
<p>
This news gave a tremendous impulse to the brimming eyes of the
housekeeper, niece, and Sancho Panza his good squire, making the tears
burst from their eyes and a host of sighs from their hearts; for of a
truth, as has been said more than once, whether as plain Alonso Quixano
the Good, or as Don Quixote of La Mancha, Don Quixote was always of a
gentle disposition and kindly in all his ways, and hence he was beloved,
not only by those of his own house, but by all who knew him.
</p>
<p>
The notary came in with the rest, and as soon as the preamble of the will
had been set out and Don Quixote had commended his soul to God with all
the devout formalities that are usual, coming to the bequests, he said,
“Item, it is my will that, touching certain moneys in the hands of
Sancho Panza (whom in my madness I made my squire), inasmuch as between
him and me there have been certain accounts and debits and credits, no
claim be made against him, nor any account demanded of him in respect of
them; but that if anything remain over and above, after he has paid
himself what I owe him, the balance, which will be but little, shall be
his, and much good may it do him; and if, as when I was mad I had a share
in giving him the government of an island, so, now that I am in my senses,
I could give him that of a kingdom, it should be his, for the simplicity
of his character and the fidelity of his conduct deserve it.” And
then, turning to Sancho, he said, “Forgive me, my friend, that I led
thee to seem as mad as myself, making thee fall into the same error I
myself fell into, that there were and still are knights-errant in the
world.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah!” said Sancho weeping, “don’t die, master, but
take my advice and live many years; for the foolishest thing a man can do
in this life is to let himself die without rhyme or reason, without
anybody killing him, or any hands but melancholy’s making an end of
him. Come, don’t be lazy, but get up from your bed and let us take
to the fields in shepherd’s trim as we agreed. Perhaps behind some
bush we shall find the lady Dulcinea disenchanted, as fine as fine can be.
If it be that you are dying of vexation at having been vanquished, lay the
blame on me, and say you were overthrown because I had girthed Rocinante
badly; besides you must have seen in your books of chivalry that it is a
common thing for knights to upset one another, and for him who is
conquered to-day to be conqueror to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>
“Very true,” said Samson, “and good Sancho Panza’s
view of these cases is quite right.”
</p>
<p>
“Sirs, not so fast,” said Don Quixote, “‘in last
year’s nests there are no birds this year.’ I was mad, now I
am in my senses; I was Don Quixote of La Mancha, I am now, as I said,
Alonso Quixano the Good; and may my repentance and sincerity restore me to
the esteem you used to have for me; and now let Master Notary proceed.
</p>
<p>
“Item, I leave all my property absolutely to Antonia Quixana my
niece, here present, after all has been deducted from the most available
portion of it that may be required to satisfy the bequests I have made.
And the first disbursement I desire to be made is the payment of the wages
I owe for the time my housekeeper has served me, with twenty ducats, over
and above, for a gown. The curate and the bachelor Samson Carrasco, now
present, I appoint my executors.
</p>
<p>
“Item, it is my wish that if Antonia Quixana, my niece, desires to
marry, she shall marry a man of whom it shall be first of all ascertained
by information taken that he does not know what books of chivalry are; and
if it should be proved that he does, and if, in spite of this, my niece
insists upon marrying him, and does marry him, then that she shall forfeit
the whole of what I have left her, which my executors shall devote to
works of charity as they please.
</p>
<p>
“Item, I entreat the aforesaid gentlemen my executors, that, if any
happy chance should lead them to discover the author who is said to have
written a history now going about under the title of ‘Second Part of
the Achievements of Don Quixote of La Mancha,’ they beg of him on my
behalf as earnestly as they can to forgive me for having been, without
intending it, the cause of his writing so many and such monstrous
absurdities as he has written in it; for I am leaving the world with a
feeling of compunction at having provoked him to write them.”
</p>
<p>
With this he closed his will, and a faintness coming over him he stretched
himself out at full length on the bed. All were in a flutter and made
haste to relieve him, and during the three days he lived after that on
which he made his will he fainted away very often. The house was all in
confusion; but still the niece ate and the housekeeper drank and Sancho
Panza enjoyed himself; for inheriting property wipes out or softens down
in the heir the feeling of grief the dead man might be expected to leave
behind him.

</p>
<p>
At last Don Quixote’s end came, after he had received all the
sacraments, and had in full and forcible terms expressed his detestation
of books of chivalry. The notary was there at the time, and he said that
in no book of chivalry had he ever read of any knight-errant dying in his
bed so calmly and so like a Christian as Don Quixote, who amid the tears
and lamentations of all present yielded up his spirit, that is to say
died. On perceiving it the curate begged the notary to bear witness that
Alonso Quixano the Good, commonly called Don Quixote of La Mancha, had
passed away from this present life, and died naturally; and said he
desired this testimony in order to remove the possibility of any other
author save Cide Hamete Benengeli bringing him to life again falsely and
making interminable stories out of his achievements.
</p>
<p>
Such was the end of the Ingenious Gentleman of La Mancha, whose village
Cide Hamete would not indicate precisely, in order to leave all the towns
and villages of La Mancha to contend among themselves for the right to
adopt him and claim him as a son, as the seven cities of Greece contended
for Homer. The lamentations of Sancho and the niece and housekeeper are
omitted here, as well as the new epitaphs upon his tomb; Samson Carrasco,
however, put the following lines:
</p>
<p class="poem">
A doughty gentleman lies here;<br>
A stranger all his life to fear;<br>
Nor in his death could Death prevail,<br>
In that last hour, to make him quail.<br>
<br>
He for the world but little cared;<br>
And at his feats the world was scared;<br>
A crazy man his life he passed,<br>
But in his senses died at last.
</p>
<p>
And said most sage Cide Hamete to his pen, “Rest here, hung up by
this brass wire, upon this shelf, O my pen, whether of skilful make or
clumsy cut I know not; here shalt thou remain long ages hence, unless
presumptuous or malignant story-tellers take thee down to profane thee.
But ere they touch thee warn them, and, as best thou canst, say to them:
</p>
<p class="poem">
Hold off! ye weaklings; hold your hands!<br>
Adventure it let none,<br>
For this emprise, my lord the king,<br>
Was meant for me alone.
</p>
<p>
For me alone was Don Quixote born, and I for him; it was his to act, mine
to write; we two together make but one, notwithstanding and in spite of
that pretended Tordesillesque writer who has ventured or would venture
with his great, coarse, ill-trimmed ostrich quill to write the
achievements of my valiant knight;—no burden for his shoulders, nor
subject for his frozen wit: whom, if perchance thou shouldst come to know
him, thou shalt warn to leave at rest where they lie the weary mouldering
bones of Don Quixote, and not to attempt to carry him off, in opposition
to all the privileges of death, to Old Castile, making him rise from the
grave where in reality and truth he lies stretched at full length,
powerless to make any third expedition or new sally; for the two that he
has already made, so much to the enjoyment and approval of everybody to
whom they have become known, in this as well as in foreign countries, are
quite sufficient for the purpose of turning into ridicule the whole of
those made by the whole set of the knights-errant; and so doing shalt thou
discharge thy Christian calling, giving good counsel to one that bears
ill-will to thee. And I shall remain satisfied, and proud to have been the
first who has ever enjoyed the fruit of his writings as fully as he could
desire; for my desire has been no other than to deliver over to the
detestation of mankind the false and foolish tales of the books of
chivalry, which, thanks to that of my true Don Quixote, are even now
tottering, and doubtless doomed to fall for ever. Farewell.”

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all

</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this

</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all

the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

</div><div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
