WHEREIN IS TOLD THE DISTRESSED DUENNA’S TALE OF HER MISFORTUNES

<p>
Following the melancholy musicians there filed into the garden as many as
twelve duennas, in two lines, all dressed in ample mourning robes
apparently of milled serge, with hoods of fine white gauze so long that
they allowed only the border of the robe to be seen. Behind them came the
Countess Trifaldi, the squire Trifaldin of the White Beard leading her by
the hand, clad in the finest unnapped black baize, such that, had it a
nap, every tuft would have shown as big as a Martos chickpea; the tail, or
skirt, or whatever it might be called, ended in three points which were
borne up by the hands of three pages, likewise dressed in mourning,
forming an elegant geometrical figure with the three acute angles made by
the three points, from which all who saw the peaked skirt concluded that
it must be because of it the countess was called Trifaldi, as though it
were Countess of the Three Skirts; and Benengeli says it was so, and that
by her right name she was called the Countess Lobuna, because wolves bred
in great numbers in her country; and if, instead of wolves, they had been
foxes, she would have been called the Countess Zorruna, as it was the
custom in those parts for lords to take distinctive titles from the thing
or things most abundant in their dominions; this countess, however, in
honour of the new fashion of her skirt, dropped Lobuna and took up
Trifaldi.
</p>
<p>
The twelve duennas and the lady came on at procession pace, their faces
being covered with black veils, not transparent ones like Trifaldin’s,
but so close that they allowed nothing to be seen through them. As soon as
the band of duennas was fully in sight, the duke, the duchess, and Don
Quixote stood up, as well as all who were watching the slow-moving
procession. The twelve duennas halted and formed a lane, along which the
Distressed One advanced, Trifaldin still holding her hand. On seeing this
the duke, the duchess, and Don Quixote went some twelve paces forward to
meet her. She then, kneeling on the ground, said in a voice hoarse and
rough, rather than fine and delicate, “May it please your highnesses
not to offer such courtesies to this your servant, I should say to this
your handmaid, for I am in such distress that I shall never be able to
make a proper return, because my strange and unparalleled misfortune has
carried off my wits, and I know not whither; but it must be a long way
off, for the more I look for them the less I find them.”
</p>
<p>
“He would be wanting in wits, señora countess,” said the duke,
“who did not perceive your worth by your person, for at a glance it
may be seen it deserves all the cream of courtesy and flower of polite
usage;” and raising her up by the hand he led her to a seat beside
the duchess, who likewise received her with great urbanity. Don Quixote
remained silent, while Sancho was dying to see the features of Trifaldi
and one or two of her many duennas; but there was no possibility of it
until they themselves displayed them of their own accord and free will.
</p>
<p>
All kept still, waiting to see who would break silence, which the
Distressed Duenna did in these words: “I am confident, most mighty
lord, most fair lady, and most discreet company, that my most miserable
misery will be accorded a reception no less dispassionate than generous
and condolent in your most valiant bosoms, for it is one that is enough to
melt marble, soften diamonds, and mollify the steel of the most hardened
hearts in the world; but ere it is proclaimed to your hearing, not to say
your ears, I would fain be enlightened whether there be present in this
society, circle, or company, that knight immaculatissimus, Don Quixote de
la Manchissima, and his squirissimus Panza.”
</p>
<p>
“The Panza is here,” said Sancho, before anyone could reply,
“and Don Quixotissimus too; and so, most distressedest Duenissima,
you may say what you willissimus, for we are all readissimus to do you any
servissimus.”
</p>
<p>
On this Don Quixote rose, and addressing the Distressed Duenna, said,
“If your sorrows, afflicted lady, can indulge in any hope of relief
from the valour or might of any knight-errant, here are mine, which,
feeble and limited though they be, shall be entirely devoted to your
service. I am Don Quixote of La Mancha, whose calling it is to give aid to
the needy of all sorts; and that being so, it is not necessary for you,
señora, to make any appeal to benevolence, or deal in preambles, only to
tell your woes plainly and straightforwardly: for you have hearers that
will know how, if not to remedy them, to sympathise with them.”
</p>
<p>
On hearing this, the Distressed Duenna made as though she would throw
herself at Don Quixote’s feet, and actually did fall before them and
said, as she strove to embrace them, “Before these feet and legs I
cast myself, O unconquered knight, as before, what they are, the
foundations and pillars of knight-errantry; these feet I desire to kiss,
for upon their steps hangs and depends the sole remedy for my misfortune,
O valorous errant, whose veritable achievements leave behind and eclipse
the fabulous ones of the Amadises, Esplandians, and Belianises!”
Then turning from Don Quixote to Sancho Panza, and grasping his hands, she
said, “O thou, most loyal squire that ever served knight-errant in
this present age or ages past, whose goodness is more extensive than the
beard of Trifaldin my companion here of present, well mayest thou boast
thyself that, in serving the great Don Quixote, thou art serving, summed
up in one, the whole host of knights that have ever borne arms in the
world. I conjure thee, by what thou owest to thy most loyal goodness, that
thou wilt become my kind intercessor with thy master, that he speedily
give aid to this most humble and most unfortunate countess.”
</p>
<p>
To this Sancho made answer, “As to my goodness, señora, being as
long and as great as your squire’s beard, it matters very little to
me; may I have my soul well bearded and moustached when it comes to quit
this life, that’s the point; about beards here below I care little
or nothing; but without all these blandishments and prayers, I will beg my
master (for I know he loves me, and, besides, he has need of me just now
for a certain business) to help and aid your worship as far as he can;
unpack your woes and lay them before us, and leave us to deal with them,
for we’ll be all of one mind.”
</p>
<p>
The duke and duchess, as it was they who had made the experiment of this
adventure, were ready to burst with laughter at all this, and between
themselves they commended the clever acting of the Trifaldi, who,
returning to her seat, said, “Queen Doña Maguncia reigned over the
famous kingdom of Kandy, which lies between the great Trapobana and the
Southern Sea, two leagues beyond Cape Comorin. She was the widow of King
Archipiela, her lord and husband, and of their marriage they had issue the
Princess Antonomasia, heiress of the kingdom; which Princess Antonomasia
was reared and brought up under my care and direction, I being the oldest
and highest in rank of her mother’s duennas. Time passed, and the
young Antonomasia reached the age of fourteen, and such a perfection of
beauty, that nature could not raise it higher. Then, it must not be
supposed her intelligence was childish; she was as intelligent as she was
fair, and she was fairer than all the world; and is so still, unless the
envious fates and hard-hearted sisters three have cut for her the thread
of life. But that they have not, for Heaven will not suffer so great a
wrong to Earth, as it would be to pluck unripe the grapes of the fairest
vineyard on its surface. Of this beauty, to which my poor feeble tongue
has failed to do justice, countless princes, not only of that country, but
of others, were enamoured, and among them a private gentleman, who was at
the court, dared to raise his thoughts to the heaven of so great beauty,
trusting to his youth, his gallant bearing, his numerous accomplishments
and graces, and his quickness and readiness of wit; for I may tell your
highnesses, if I am not wearying you, that he played the guitar so as to
make it speak, and he was, besides, a poet and a great dancer, and he
could make birdcages so well, that by making them alone he might have
gained a livelihood, had he found himself reduced to utter poverty; and
gifts and graces of this kind are enough to bring down a mountain, not to
say a tender young girl. But all his gallantry, wit, and gaiety, all his
graces and accomplishments, would have been of little or no avail towards
gaining the fortress of my pupil, had not the impudent thief taken the
precaution of gaining me over first. First, the villain and heartless
vagabond sought to win my good-will and purchase my compliance, so as to
get me, like a treacherous warder, to deliver up to him the keys of the
fortress I had in charge. In a word, he gained an influence over my mind,
and overcame my resolutions with I know not what trinkets and jewels he
gave me; but it was some verses I heard him singing one night from a
grating that opened on the street where he lived, that, more than anything
else, made me give way and led to my fall; and if I remember rightly they
ran thus:
</p>
<p class="poem">
From that sweet enemy of mine<br>
    My bleeding heart hath had its wound;<br>
    And to increase the pain I’m bound<br>
To suffer and to make no sign.
</p>
<p>
The lines seemed pearls to me and his voice sweet as syrup; and
afterwards, I may say ever since then, looking at the misfortune into
which I have fallen, I have thought that poets, as Plato advised, ought to
be banished from all well-ordered States; at least the amatory ones, for
they write verses, not like those of ‘The Marquis of Mantua,’
that delight and draw tears from the women and children, but sharp-pointed
conceits that pierce the heart like soft thorns, and like the lightning
strike it, leaving the raiment uninjured. Another time he sang:
</p>
<p class="poem">
Come Death, so subtly veiled that I<br>
    Thy coming know not, how or when,<br>
    Lest it should give me life again<br>
To find how sweet it is to die.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
—and other verses and burdens of the same sort, such as enchant when sung
and fascinate when written. And then, when they condescend to compose a sort of
verse that was at that time in vogue in Kandy, which they call seguidillas!
Then it is that hearts leap and laughter breaks forth, and the body grows
restless and all the senses turn quicksilver. And so I say, sirs, that these
troubadours richly deserve to be banished to the isles of the lizards. Though
it is not they that are in fault, but the simpletons that extol them, and the
fools that believe in them; and had I been the faithful duenna I should have
been, his stale conceits would have never moved me, nor should I have been
taken in by such phrases as ‘in death I live,’ ‘in ice I
burn,’ ‘in flames I shiver,’ ‘hopeless I hope,’
‘I go and stay,’ and paradoxes of that sort which their writings
are full of. And then when they promise the Phœnix of Arabia, the crown of
Ariadne, the horses of the Sun, the pearls of the South, the gold of Tibar, and
the balsam of Panchaia! Then it is they give a loose to their pens, for it
costs them little to make promises they have no intention or power of
fulfilling. But where am I wandering to? Woe is me, unfortunate being! What
madness or folly leads me to speak of the faults of others, when there is so
much to be said about my own? Again, woe is me, hapless that I am! it was not
verses that conquered me, but my own simplicity; it was not music made me
yield, but my own imprudence; my own great ignorance and little caution opened
the way and cleared the path for Don Clavijo’s advances, for that was the
name of the gentleman I have referred to; and so, with my help as go-between,
he found his way many a time into the chamber of the deceived Antonomasia
(deceived not by him but by me) under the title of a lawful husband; for,
sinner though I was, I would not have allowed him to approach the edge of her
shoe-sole without being her husband. No, no, not that; marriage must come first
in any business of this sort that I take in hand. But there was one hitch in
this case, which was that of inequality of rank, Don Clavijo being a private
gentleman, and the Princess Antonomasia, as I said, heiress to the kingdom. The
entanglement remained for some time a secret, kept hidden by my cunning
precautions, until I perceived that a certain expansion of waist in Antonomasia
must before long disclose it, the dread of which made us all there take counsel
together, and it was agreed that before the mischief came to light, Don Clavijo
should demand Antonomasia as his wife before the Vicar, in virtue of an
agreement to marry him made by the princess, and drafted by my wit in such
binding terms that the might of Samson could not have broken it. The necessary
steps were taken; the Vicar saw the agreement, and took the lady’s
confession; she confessed everything in full, and he ordered her into the
custody of a very worthy alguacil of the court.”
</p>
<p>
“Are there alguacils of the court in Kandy, too,” said Sancho
at this, “and poets, and seguidillas? I swear I think the world is
the same all over! But make haste, Señora Trifaldi; for it is late, and I
am dying to know the end of this long story.”
</p>
<p>
“I will,” replied the countess.
