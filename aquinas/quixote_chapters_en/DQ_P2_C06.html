OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CHAPTERS IN THE WHOLE HISTORY

</p>
<p>
While Sancho Panza and his wife, Teresa Cascajo, held the above irrelevant
conversation, Don Quixote’s niece and housekeeper were not idle, for
by a thousand signs they began to perceive that their uncle and master
meant to give them the slip the third time, and once more betake himself
to his, for them, ill-errant chivalry. They strove by all the means in
their power to divert him from such an unlucky scheme; but it was all
preaching in the desert and hammering cold iron. Nevertheless, among many
other representations made to him, the housekeeper said to him, “In
truth, master, if you do not keep still and stay quiet at home, and give
over roaming mountains and valleys like a troubled spirit, looking for
what they say are called adventures, but what I call misfortunes, I shall
have to make complaint to God and the king with loud supplication to send
some remedy.”
</p>
<p>
To which Don Quixote replied, “What answer God will give to your
complaints, housekeeper, I know not, nor what his Majesty will answer
either; I only know that if I were king I should decline to answer the
numberless silly petitions they present every day; for one of the greatest
among the many troubles kings have is being obliged to listen to all and
answer all, and therefore I should be sorry that any affairs of mine
should worry him.”
</p>
<p>
Whereupon the housekeeper said, “Tell us, señor, at his Majesty’s
court are there no knights?”
</p>
<p>
“There are,” replied Don Quixote, “and plenty of them;
and it is right there should be, to set off the dignity of the prince, and
for the greater glory of the king’s majesty.”
</p>
<p>
“Then might not your worship,” said she, “be one of
those that, without stirring a step, serve their king and lord in his
court?”
</p>
<p>
“Recollect, my friend,” said Don Quixote, “all knights
cannot be courtiers, nor can all courtiers be knights-errant, nor need
they be. There must be all sorts in the world; and though we may be all
knights, there is a great difference between one and another; for the
courtiers, without quitting their chambers, or the threshold of the court,
range the world over by looking at a map, without its costing them a
farthing, and without suffering heat or cold, hunger or thirst; but we,
the true knights-errant, measure the whole earth with our own feet,
exposed to the sun, to the cold, to the air, to the inclemencies of
heaven, by day and night, on foot and on horseback; nor do we only know
enemies in pictures, but in their own real shapes; and at all risks and on
all occasions we attack them, without any regard to childish points or
rules of single combat, whether one has or has not a shorter lance or
sword, whether one carries relics or any secret contrivance about him,
whether or not the sun is to be divided and portioned out, and other
niceties of the sort that are observed in set combats of man to man, that
you know nothing about, but I do. And you must know besides, that the true
knight-errant, though he may see ten giants, that not only touch the
clouds with their heads but pierce them, and that go, each of them, on two
tall towers by way of legs, and whose arms are like the masts of mighty
ships, and each eye like a great mill-wheel, and glowing brighter than a
glass furnace, must not on any account be dismayed by them. On the
contrary, he must attack and fall upon them with a gallant bearing and a
fearless heart, and, if possible, vanquish and destroy them, even though
they have for armour the shells of a certain fish, that they say are
harder than diamonds, and in place of swords wield trenchant blades of
Damascus steel, or clubs studded with spikes also of steel, such as I have
more than once seen. All this I say, housekeeper, that you may see the
difference there is between the one sort of knight and the other; and it
would be well if there were no prince who did not set a higher value on
this second, or more properly speaking first, kind of knights-errant; for,
as we read in their histories, there have been some among them who have
been the salvation, not merely of one kingdom, but of many.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah, señor,” here exclaimed the niece, “remember that
all this you are saying about knights-errant is fable and fiction; and
their histories, if indeed they were not burned, would deserve, each of
them, to have a sambenito put on it, or some mark by which it might be
known as infamous and a corrupter of good manners.”
</p>
<p>
“By the God that gives me life,” said Don Quixote, “if
thou wert not my full niece, being daughter of my own sister, I would
inflict a chastisement upon thee for the blasphemy thou hast uttered that
all the world should ring with. What! can it be that a young hussy that
hardly knows how to handle a dozen lace-bobbins dares to wag her tongue
and criticise the histories of knights-errant? What would Señor Amadis say
if he heard of such a thing? He, however, no doubt would forgive thee, for
he was the most humble-minded and courteous knight of his time, and
moreover a great protector of damsels; but some there are that might have
heard thee, and it would not have been well for thee in that case; for
they are not all courteous or mannerly; some are ill-conditioned
scoundrels; nor is it everyone that calls himself a gentleman, that is so
in all respects; some are gold, others pinchbeck, and all look like
gentlemen, but not all can stand the touchstone of truth. There are men of
low rank who strain themselves to bursting to pass for gentlemen, and high
gentlemen who, one would fancy, were dying to pass for men of low rank;
the former raise themselves by their ambition or by their virtues, the
latter debase themselves by their lack of spirit or by their vices; and
one has need of experience and discernment to distinguish these two kinds
of gentlemen, so much alike in name and so different in conduct.”
</p>
<p>
“God bless me!” said the niece, “that you should know so
much, uncle—enough, if need be, to get up into a pulpit and go
preach in the streets—and yet that you should fall into a delusion
so great and a folly so manifest as to try to make yourself out vigorous
when you are old, strong when you are sickly, able to put straight what is
crooked when you yourself are bent by age, and, above all, a caballero
when you are not one; for though gentlefolk may be so, poor men are
nothing of the kind!”
</p>
<p>
“There is a great deal of truth in what you say, niece,”
returned Don Quixote, “and I could tell you somewhat about birth
that would astonish you; but, not to mix up things human and divine, I
refrain. Look you, my dears, all the lineages in the world (attend to what
I am saying) can be reduced to four sorts, which are these: those that had
humble beginnings, and went on spreading and extending themselves until
they attained surpassing greatness; those that had great beginnings and
maintained them, and still maintain and uphold the greatness of their
origin; those, again, that from a great beginning have ended in a point
like a pyramid, having reduced and lessened their original greatness till
it has come to nought, like the point of a pyramid, which, relatively to
its base or foundation, is nothing; and then there are those—and it
is they that are the most numerous—that have had neither an
illustrious beginning nor a remarkable mid-course, and so will have an end
without a name, like an ordinary plebeian line. Of the first, those that
had an humble origin and rose to the greatness they still preserve, the
Ottoman house may serve as an example, which from an humble and lowly
shepherd, its founder, has reached the height at which we now see it. For
examples of the second sort of lineage, that began with greatness and
maintains it still without adding to it, there are the many princes who
have inherited the dignity, and maintain themselves in their inheritance,
without increasing or diminishing it, keeping peacefully within the limits
of their states. Of those that began great and ended in a point, there are
thousands of examples, for all the Pharaohs and Ptolemies of Egypt, the
Cæsars of Rome, and the whole herd (if I may apply such a word to them)
of countless princes, monarchs, lords, Medes, Assyrians, Persians, Greeks,
and barbarians, all these lineages and lordships have ended in a point and
come to nothing, they themselves as well as their founders, for it would
be impossible now to find one of their descendants, and, even should we
find one, it would be in some lowly and humble condition. Of plebeian
lineages I have nothing to say, save that they merely serve to swell the
number of those that live, without any eminence to entitle them to any
fame or praise beyond this. From all I have said I would have you gather,
my poor innocents, that great is the confusion among lineages, and that
only those are seen to be great and illustrious that show themselves so by
the virtue, wealth, and generosity of their possessors. I have said
virtue, wealth, and generosity, because a great man who is vicious will be
a great example of vice, and a rich man who is not generous will be merely
a miserly beggar; for the possessor of wealth is not made happy by
possessing it, but by spending it, and not by spending as he pleases, but
by knowing how to spend it well. The poor gentleman has no way of showing
that he is a gentleman but by virtue, by being affable, well-bred,
courteous, gentle-mannered, and kindly, not haughty, arrogant, or
censorious, but above all by being charitable; for by two maravedis given
with a cheerful heart to the poor, he will show himself as generous as he
who distributes alms with bell-ringing, and no one that perceives him to
be endowed with the virtues I have named, even though he know him not,
will fail to recognise and set him down as one of good blood; and it would
be strange were it not so; praise has ever been the reward of virtue, and
those who are virtuous cannot fail to receive commendation. There are two
roads, my daughters, by which men may reach wealth and honours; one is
that of letters, the other that of arms. I have more of arms than of
letters in my composition, and, judging by my inclination to arms, was
born under the influence of the planet Mars. I am, therefore, in a measure
constrained to follow that road, and by it I must travel in spite of all
the world, and it will be labour in vain for you to urge me to resist what
heaven wills, fate ordains, reason requires, and, above all, my own
inclination favours; for knowing as I do the countless toils that are the
accompaniments of knight-errantry, I know, too, the infinite blessings
that are attained by it; I know that the path of virtue is very narrow,
and the road of vice broad and spacious; I know their ends and goals are
different, for the broad and easy road of vice ends in death, and the
narrow and toilsome one of virtue in life, and not transitory life, but in
that which has no end; I know, as our great Castilian poet says, that-
</p>
<p class="poem">
It is by rugged paths like these they go<br>
That scale the heights of immortality,<br>
Unreached by those that falter here below.”
</p>
<p>
“Woe is me!” exclaimed the niece, “my lord is a poet,
too! He knows everything, and he can do everything; I will bet, if he
chose to turn mason, he could make a house as easily as a cage.”
</p>
<p>
“I can tell you, niece,” replied Don Quixote, “if these
chivalrous thoughts did not engage all my faculties, there would be
nothing that I could not do, nor any sort of knickknack that would not
come from my hands, particularly cages and tooth-picks.”
</p>
<p>
At this moment there came a knocking at the door, and when they asked who
was there, Sancho Panza made answer that it was he. The instant the
housekeeper knew who it was, she ran to hide herself so as not to see him;
in such abhorrence did she hold him. The niece let him in, and his master
Don Quixote came forward to receive him with open arms, and the pair shut
themselves up in his room, where they had another conversation not
inferior to the previous one.
