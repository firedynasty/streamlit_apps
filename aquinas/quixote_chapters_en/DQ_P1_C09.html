<a id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br>
IN WHICH IS CONCLUDED AND FINISHED THE TERRIFIC BATTLE BETWEEN THE GALLANT

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
In the First Part of this history we left the valiant Biscayan and the
renowned Don Quixote with drawn swords uplifted, ready to deliver two such
furious slashing blows that if they had fallen full and fair they would at
least have split and cleft them asunder from top to toe and laid them open
like a pomegranate; and at this so critical point the delightful history
came to a stop and stood cut short without any intimation from the author
where what was missing was to be found.
</p>
<p>
This distressed me greatly, because the pleasure derived from having read
such a small portion turned to vexation at the thought of the poor chance
that presented itself of finding the large part that, so it seemed to me,
was missing of such an interesting tale. It appeared to me to be a thing
impossible and contrary to all precedent that so good a knight should have
been without some sage to undertake the task of writing his marvellous
achievements; a thing that was never wanting to any of those
knights-errant who, they say, went after adventures; for every one of them
had one or two sages as if made on purpose, who not only recorded their
deeds but described their most trifling thoughts and follies, however
secret they might be; and such a good knight could not have been so
unfortunate as not to have what Platir and others like him had in
abundance. And so I could not bring myself to believe that such a gallant
tale had been left maimed and mutilated, and I laid the blame on Time, the
devourer and destroyer of all things, that had either concealed or
consumed it.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, it struck me that, inasmuch as among his books there
had been found such modern ones as “The Enlightenment of Jealousy” and the
“Nymphs and Shepherds of Henares,” his story must likewise be modern, and
that though it might not be written, it might exist in the memory of the
people of his village and of those in the neighbourhood. This reflection
kept me perplexed and longing to know really and truly the whole life and
wondrous deeds of our famous Spaniard, Don Quixote of La Mancha, light and
mirror of Manchegan chivalry, and the first that in our age and in these
so evil days devoted himself to the labour and exercise of the arms of
knight-errantry, righting wrongs, succouring widows, and protecting
damsels of that sort that used to ride about, whip in hand, on their
palfreys, with all their virginity about them, from mountain to mountain
and valley to valley—for, if it were not for some ruffian, or boor
with a hood and hatchet, or monstrous giant, that forced them, there were
in days of yore damsels that at the end of eighty years, in all which time
they had never slept a day under a roof, went to their graves as much
maids as the mothers that bore them. I say, then, that in these and other
respects our gallant Don Quixote is worthy of everlasting and notable
praise, nor should it be withheld even from me for the labour and pains
spent in searching for the conclusion of this delightful history; though I
know well that if Heaven, chance and good fortune had not helped me, the
world would have remained deprived of an entertainment and pleasure that
for a couple of hours or so may well occupy him who shall read it
attentively. The discovery of it occurred in this way.
</p>
<p>
One day, as I was in the Alcana of Toledo, a boy came up to sell some
pamphlets and old papers to a silk mercer, and, as I am fond of reading
even the very scraps of paper in the streets, led by this natural bent of
mine I took up one of the pamphlets the boy had for sale, and saw that it
was in characters which I recognised as Arabic, and as I was unable to
read them though I could recognise them, I looked about to see if there
were any Spanish-speaking Morisco at hand to read them for me; nor was
there any great difficulty in finding such an interpreter, for even had I
sought one for an older and better language I should have found him. In
short, chance provided me with one, who when I told him what I wanted and
put the book into his hands, opened it in the middle and after reading a
little in it began to laugh. I asked him what he was laughing at, and he
replied that it was at something the book had written in the margin by way
of a note. I bade him tell it to me; and he still laughing said, “In the
margin, as I told you, this is written: ‘<i>This Dulcinea del Toboso so often
mentioned in this history, had, they say, the best hand of any woman in
all La Mancha for salting pigs</i>.’”
</p>
<p>
When I heard Dulcinea del Toboso named, I was struck with surprise and
amazement, for it occurred to me at once that these pamphlets contained
the history of Don Quixote. With this idea I pressed him to read the
beginning, and doing so, turning the Arabic offhand into Castilian, he
told me it meant, “<i>History of Don Quixote of La Mancha, written by Cid
Hamete Benengeli, an Arab historian</i>.” It required great caution to hide
the joy I felt when the title of the book reached my ears, and snatching
it from the silk mercer, I bought all the papers and pamphlets from the
boy for half a real; and if he had had his wits about him and had known
how eager I was for them, he might have safely calculated on making more
than six reals by the bargain. I withdrew at once with the Morisco into
the cloister of the cathedral, and begged him to turn all these pamphlets
that related to Don Quixote into the Castilian tongue, without omitting or
adding anything to them, offering him whatever payment he pleased. He was
satisfied with two arrobas of raisins and two bushels of wheat, and
promised to translate them faithfully and with all despatch; but to make
the matter easier, and not to let such a precious find out of my hands, I
took him to my house, where in little more than a month and a half he
translated the whole just as it is set down here.
</p>
<p>
In the first pamphlet the battle between Don Quixote and the Biscayan was
drawn to the very life, they planted in the same attitude as the history
describes, their swords raised, and the one protected by his buckler, the
other by his cushion, and the Biscayan’s mule so true to nature that it
could be seen to be a hired one a bowshot off. The Biscayan had an
inscription under his feet which said, “<i>Don Sancho de Azpeitia</i>,” which no
doubt must have been his name; and at the feet of Rocinante was another
that said, “<i>Don Quixote</i>.” Rocinante was marvellously portrayed, so long
and thin, so lank and lean, with so much backbone and so far gone in
consumption, that he showed plainly with what judgment and propriety the
name of Rocinante had been bestowed upon him. Near him was Sancho Panza
holding the halter of his ass, at whose feet was another label that said,
“Sancho Zancas,” and according to the picture, he must have had a big
belly, a short body, and long shanks, for which reason, no doubt, the
names of Panza and Zancas were given him, for by these two surnames the
history several times calls him. Some other trifling particulars might be
mentioned, but they are all of slight importance and have nothing to do
with the true relation of the history; and no history can be bad so long
as it is true.
</p>
<p>
If against the present one any objection be raised on the score of its
truth, it can only be that its author was an Arab, as lying is a very
common propensity with those of that nation; though, as they are such
enemies of ours, it is conceivable that there were omissions rather than
additions made in the course of it. And this is my own opinion; for, where
he could and should give freedom to his pen in praise of so worthy a
knight, he seems to me deliberately to pass it over in silence; which is
ill done and worse contrived, for it is the business and duty of
historians to be exact, truthful, and wholly free from passion, and
neither interest nor fear, hatred nor love, should make them swerve from
the path of truth, whose mother is history, rival of time, storehouse of
deeds, witness for the past, example and counsel for the present, and
warning for the future. In this I know will be found all that can be
desired in the pleasantest, and if it be wanting in any good quality, I
maintain it is the fault of its hound of an author and not the fault of
the subject. To be brief, its Second Part, according to the translation,
began in this way:
</p>
<p>
With trenchant swords upraised and poised on high, it seemed as though the
two valiant and wrathful combatants stood threatening heaven, and earth,
and hell, with such resolution and determination did they bear themselves.
The fiery Biscayan was the first to strike a blow, which was delivered
with such force and fury that had not the sword turned in its course, that
single stroke would have sufficed to put an end to the bitter struggle and
to all the adventures of our knight; but that good fortune which reserved
him for greater things, turned aside the sword of his adversary, so that
although it smote him upon the left shoulder, it did him no more harm than
to strip all that side of its armour, carrying away a great part of his
helmet with half of his ear, all which with fearful ruin fell to the
ground, leaving him in a sorry plight.
</p>
<p>
Good God! Who is there that could properly describe the rage that filled
the heart of our Manchegan when he saw himself dealt with in this fashion?
All that can be said is, it was such that he again raised himself in his
stirrups, and, grasping his sword more firmly with both hands, he came
down on the Biscayan with such fury, smiting him full over the cushion and
over the head, that—even so good a shield proving useless—as
if a mountain had fallen on him, he began to bleed from nose, mouth, and
ears, reeling as if about to fall backwards from his mule, as no doubt he
would have done had he not flung his arms about its neck; at the same
time, however, he slipped his feet out of the stirrups and then unclasped
his arms, and the mule, taking fright at the terrible blow, made off
across the plain, and with a few plunges flung its master to the ground.
Don Quixote stood looking on very calmly, and, when he saw him fall,
leaped from his horse and with great briskness ran to him, and, presenting
the point of his sword to his eyes, bade him surrender, or he would cut
his head off. The Biscayan was so bewildered that he was unable to answer
a word, and it would have gone hard with him, so blind was Don Quixote,
had not the ladies in the coach, who had hitherto been watching the combat
in great terror, hastened to where he stood and implored him with earnest
entreaties to grant them the great grace and favour of sparing their
squire’s life; to which Don Quixote replied with much gravity and dignity,
“In truth, fair ladies, I am well content to do what ye ask of me; but it
must be on one condition and understanding, which is that this knight
promise me to go to the village of El Toboso, and on my behalf present
himself before the peerless lady Dulcinea, that she deal with him as shall
be most pleasing to her.”
</p>
<p>
The terrified and disconsolate ladies, without discussing Don Quixote’s
demand or asking who Dulcinea might be, promised that their squire should
do all that had been commanded.
</p>
<p>
“Then, on the faith of that promise,” said Don Quixote, “I shall do him no
further harm, though he well deserves it of me.”
