OF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE

</p>
<p>
The innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho what
was amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had
fallen down from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper
had a wife whose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly
have, for she was by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of
her neighbours, so she at once set about tending Don Quixote, and made her
young daughter, a very comely girl, help her in taking care of her guest.
There was besides in the inn, as servant, an Asturian lass with a broad
face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of one eye and not very sound in the
other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, made up for all her defects;
she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and her shoulders,
which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the ground more than
she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the two
made up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident
signs of having formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which
there was also quartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond
our Don Quixote’s, and, though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of
his mules, had much the advantage of it, as Don Quixote’s consisted simply
of four rough boards on two not very even trestles, a mattress, that for
thinness might have passed for a quilt, full of pellets which, were they
not seen through the rents to be wool, would to the touch have seemed
pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and a coverlet
the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without missing
one in the reckoning.
</p>
<p>
On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and
her daughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while
Maritornes—for that was the name of the Asturian—held the
light for them, and while plastering him, the hostess, observing how full
of wheals Don Quixote was in some places, remarked that this had more the
look of blows than of a fall.
</p>
<p>
It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and
projections, and that each of them had left its mark. “Pray, señora,” he
added, “manage to save some tow, as there will be no want of someone to
use it, for my loins too are rather sore.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you must have fallen too,” said the hostess.
</p>
<p>
“I did not fall,” said Sancho Panza, “but from the shock I got at seeing
my master fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand
thwacks.”
</p>
<p>
“That may well be,” said the young girl, “for it has many a time happened
to me to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to
the ground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and
shaken as if I had really fallen.”
</p>
<p>
“There is the point, señora,” replied Sancho Panza, “that I without
dreaming at all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with
scarcely less wheals than my master, Don Quixote.”
</p>
<p>
“How is the gentleman called?” asked Maritornes the Asturian.
</p>
<p>
“Don Quixote of La Mancha,” answered Sancho Panza, “and he is a
knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in
the world this long time past.”
</p>
<p>
“What is a knight-adventurer?” said the lass.
</p>
<p>
“Are you so new in the world as not to know?” answered Sancho Panza.
“Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing
that in two words is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most
miserable and needy being in the world, and to-morrow will have two or
three crowns of kingdoms to give his squire.”
</p>
<p>
“Then how is it,” said the hostess, “that belonging to so good a master as
this, you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?”
</p>
<p>
“It is too soon yet,” answered Sancho, “for we have only been a month
going in quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can
be called one, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for
another thing is found; however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of
this wound, or fall, and I am left none the worse of it, I would not
change my hopes for the best title in Spain.”
</p>
<p>
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and
sitting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand
he said to her, “Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in
having in this castle of yours sheltered my person, which is such that if
I do not myself praise it, it is because of what is commonly said, that
self-praise debaseth; but my squire will inform you who I am. I only tell
you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on my memory the service you
have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitude while life shall last
me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled and subject to its
laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between my teeth,
but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty.”
</p>
<p>
The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in
bewilderment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about
as much of them as if he had been talking Greek, though they could
perceive they were all meant for expressions of good-will and
blandishments; and not being accustomed to this kind of language, they
stared at him and wondered to themselves, for he seemed to them a man of a
different sort from those they were used to, and thanking him in pothouse
phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gave her
attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.
</p>
<p>
The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night,
and she had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the
family asleep she would come in search of him and meet his wishes
unreservedly. And it is said of this good lass that she never made
promises of the kind without fulfilling them, even though she made them in
a forest and without any witness present, for she plumed herself greatly
on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an employment as
servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck had brought
her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don
Quixote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close
beside it Sancho made his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a
blanket that looked as if it was of threadbare canvas rather than of wool.
Next to these two beds was that of the carrier, made up, as has been said,
of the pack-saddles and all the trappings of the two best mules he had,
though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, and in prime condition,
for he was one of the rich carriers of Arévalo, according to the author of
this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew him
very well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides
which Cid Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy
in all things, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence
those that have been already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant
they might be, an example that might be followed by those grave historians
who relate transactions so curtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste
of them, all the substance of the work being left in the inkstand from
carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thousand blessings on the
author of “Tablante de Ricamonte” and that of the other book in which the
deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minuteness they
describe everything!
</p>
<p>
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them
their second feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and
lay waiting for his conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time
plastered and had lain down, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his
ribs would not let him, while Don Quixote with the pain of his had his
eyes as wide open as a hare’s.

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
The inn was all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light
except that given by a lantern that hung burning in the middle of the
gateway. This strange stillness, and the thoughts, always present to our
knight’s mind, of the incidents described at every turn in the books that
were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to his imagination as
extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was that he
fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said,
all the inns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter
of the innkeeper was daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won
by his high-bred bearing, had fallen in love with him, and had promised to
come to his bed for a while that night without the knowledge of her
parents; and holding all this fantasy that he had constructed as solid
fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilous risk which his
virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to commit no
treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevere
herself and the dame Quintañona should present themselves before him.
</p>
<p>
While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour—an
unlucky one for him—arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her
smock, with bare feet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with
noiseless and cautious steps entered the chamber where the three were
quartered, in quest of the carrier; but scarcely had she gained the door
when Don Quixote perceived her, and sitting up in his bed in spite of his
plasters and the pain of his ribs, he stretched out his arms to receive
his beauteous damsel. The Asturian, who went all doubled up and in silence
with her hands before her feeling for her lover, encountered the arms of
Don Quixote, who grasped her tightly by the wrist, and drawing her towards
him, while she dared not utter a word, made her sit down on the bed. He
then felt her smock, and although it was of sackcloth it appeared to him
to be of the finest and softest silk: on her wrists she wore some glass
beads, but to him they had the sheen of precious Orient pearls: her hair,
which in some measure resembled a horse’s mane, he rated as threads of the
brightest gold of Araby, whose refulgence dimmed the sun himself: her
breath, which no doubt smelt of yesterday’s stale salad, seemed to him to
diffuse a sweet aromatic fragrance from her mouth; and, in short, he drew
her portrait in his imagination with the same features and in the same
style as that which he had seen in his books of the other princesses who,
smitten by love, came with all the adornments that are here set down, to
see the sorely wounded knight; and so great was the poor gentleman’s
blindness that neither touch, nor smell, nor anything else about the good
lass that would have made any but a carrier vomit, were enough to
undeceive him; on the contrary, he was persuaded he had the goddess of
beauty in his arms, and holding her firmly in his grasp he went on to say
in low, tender voice:
</p>
<p>
“Would that I found myself, lovely and exalted lady, in a position to
repay such a favour as that which you, by the sight of your great beauty, have
granted me; but fortune, which is never weary of persecuting the good, has
chosen to place me upon this bed, where I lie so bruised and broken that though
my inclination would gladly comply with yours it is impossible; besides, to
this impossibility another yet greater is to be added, which is the faith that
I have pledged to the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, sole lady of my most secret
thoughts; and were it not that this stood in the way I should not be so
insensible a knight as to miss the happy opportunity which your great goodness
has offered me.”
</p>
<p>
Maritornes was fretting and sweating at finding herself held so fast by
Don Quixote, and not understanding or heeding the words he addressed to
her, she strove without speaking to free herself. The worthy carrier,
whose unholy thoughts kept him awake, was aware of his doxy the moment she
entered the door, and was listening attentively to all Don Quixote said;
and jealous that the Asturian should have broken her word with him for
another, drew nearer to Don Quixote’s bed and stood still to see what
would come of this talk which he could not understand; but when he
perceived the wench struggling to get free and Don Quixote striving to
hold her, not relishing the joke he raised his arm and delivered such a
terrible cuff on the lank jaws of the amorous knight that he bathed all
his mouth in blood, and not content with this he mounted on his ribs and
with his feet tramped all over them at a pace rather smarter than a trot.
The bed which was somewhat crazy and not very firm on its feet, unable to
support the additional weight of the carrier, came to the ground, and at
the mighty crash of this the innkeeper awoke and at once concluded that it
must be some brawl of Maritornes’, because after calling loudly to her he
got no answer. With this suspicion he got up, and lighting a lamp hastened
to the quarter where he had heard the disturbance. The wench, seeing that
her master was coming and knowing that his temper was terrible, frightened
and panic-stricken made for the bed of Sancho Panza, who still slept, and
crouching upon it made a ball of herself.
</p>
<p>
The innkeeper came in exclaiming, “Where art thou, strumpet? Of course
this is some of thy work.” At this Sancho awoke, and feeling this mass
almost on top of him fancied he had the nightmare and began to distribute
fisticuffs all round, of which a certain share fell upon Maritornes, who,
irritated by the pain and flinging modesty aside, paid back so many in
return to Sancho that she woke him up in spite of himself. He then,
finding himself so handled, by whom he knew not, raising himself up as
well as he could, grappled with Maritornes, and he and she between them
began the bitterest and drollest scrimmage in the world. The carrier,
however, perceiving by the light of the innkeeper candle how it fared with
his ladylove, quitting Don Quixote, ran to bring her the help she needed;
and the innkeeper did the same but with a different intention, for his was
to chastise the lass, as he believed that beyond a doubt she alone was the
cause of all the harmony. And so, as the saying is, cat to rat, rat to
rope, rope to stick, the carrier pounded Sancho, Sancho the lass, she him,
and the innkeeper her, and all worked away so briskly that they did not
give themselves a moment’s rest; and the best of it was that the
innkeeper’s lamp went out, and as they were left in the dark they all laid
on one upon the other in a mass so unmercifully that there was not a sound
spot left where a hand could light.
</p>
<p>
It so happened that there was lodging that night in the inn a caudrillero
of what they call the Old Holy Brotherhood of Toledo, who, also hearing
the extraordinary noise of the conflict, seized his staff and the tin case
with his warrants, and made his way in the dark into the room crying:
“Hold! in the name of the Jurisdiction! Hold! in the name of the Holy
Brotherhood!”
</p>
<p>
The first that he came upon was the pummelled Don Quixote, who lay
stretched senseless on his back upon his broken-down bed, and, his hand
falling on the beard as he felt about, he continued to cry, “Help for the
Jurisdiction!” but perceiving that he whom he had laid hold of did not
move or stir, he concluded that he was dead and that those in the room
were his murderers, and with this suspicion he raised his voice still
higher, calling out, “Shut the inn gate; see that no one goes out; they
have killed a man here!” This cry startled them all, and each dropped the
contest at the point at which the voice reached him. The innkeeper
retreated to his room, the carrier to his pack-saddles, the lass to her
crib; the unlucky Don Quixote and Sancho alone were unable to move from
where they were. The cuadrillero on this let go Don Quixote’s beard, and
went out to look for a light to search for and apprehend the culprits; but
not finding one, as the innkeeper had purposely extinguished the lantern
on retreating to his room, he was compelled to have recourse to the
hearth, where after much time and trouble he lit another lamp.
