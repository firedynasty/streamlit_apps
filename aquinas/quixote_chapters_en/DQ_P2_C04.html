<a id="ch4b"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br>
IN WHICH SANCHO PANZA GIVES A SATISFACTORY REPLY TO THE DOUBTS AND

Sancho came back to Don Quixote’s house, and returning to the late
subject of conversation, he said, “As to what Señor Samson said,
that he would like to know by whom, or how, or when my ass was stolen, I
say in reply that the same night we went into the Sierra Morena, flying
from the Holy Brotherhood after that unlucky adventure of the galley
slaves, and the other of the corpse that was going to Segovia, my master
and I ensconced ourselves in a thicket, and there, my master leaning on
his lance, and I seated on my Dapple, battered and weary with the late
frays we fell asleep as if it had been on four feather mattresses; and I
in particular slept so sound, that, whoever he was, he was able to come
and prop me up on four stakes, which he put under the four corners of the
pack-saddle in such a way that he left me mounted on it, and took away
Dapple from under me without my feeling it.”
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
<img alt="p04b.jpg (270K)" src="images/p04b.jpg" style="width:100%;" id="img_images_p04b.jpg">
</div>
<p>
<a href="images/p04b.jpg" style="width:100%;" id="id-8030893235723365612"><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg" id="img_images_enlarge.jpg_123"></a><br><br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
“That is an easy matter,” said Don Quixote, “and it is
no new occurrence, for the same thing happened to Sacripante at the siege
of Albracca; the famous thief, Brunello, by the same contrivance, took his
horse from between his legs.”
</p>
<p>
“Day came,” continued Sancho, “and the moment I stirred
the stakes gave way and I fell to the ground with a mighty come down; I
looked about for the ass, but could not see him; the tears rushed to my
eyes and I raised such a lamentation that, if the author of our history
has not put it in, he may depend upon it he has left out a good thing.
Some days after, I know not how many, travelling with her ladyship the
Princess Micomicona, I saw my ass, and mounted upon him, in the dress of a
gipsy, was that Gines de Pasamonte, the great rogue and rascal that my
master and I freed from the chain.”
</p>
<p>
“That is not where the mistake is,” replied Samson; “it
is, that before the ass has turned up, the author speaks of Sancho as
being mounted on it.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what to say to that,” said Sancho, “unless
that the historian made a mistake, or perhaps it might be a blunder of the
printer’s.”
</p>
<p>
“No doubt that’s it,” said Samson; “but what
became of the hundred crowns? Did they vanish?”
</p>
<p>
To which Sancho answered, “I spent them for my own good, and my wife’s,
and my children’s, and it is they that have made my wife bear so
patiently all my wanderings on highways and byways, in the service of my
master, Don Quixote; for if after all this time I had come back to the
house without a rap and without the ass, it would have been a poor
look-out for me; and if anyone wants to know anything more about me, here
I am, ready to answer the king himself in person; and it is no affair of
anyone’s whether I took or did not take, whether I spent or did not
spend; for the whacks that were given me in these journeys were to be paid
for in money, even if they were valued at no more than four maravedis
apiece, another hundred crowns would not pay me for half of them. Let each
look to himself and not try to make out white black, and black white; for
each of us is as God made him, aye, and often worse.”
</p>
<p>
“I will take care,” said Carrasco, “to impress upon the
author of the history that, if he prints it again, he must not forget what
worthy Sancho has said, for it will raise it a good span higher.”
</p>
<p>
“Is there anything else to correct in the history, señor bachelor?”
asked Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“No doubt there is,” replied he; “but not anything that
will be of the same importance as those I have mentioned.”
</p>
<p>
“Does the author promise a second part at all?” said Don
Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“He does promise one,” replied Samson; “but he says he
has not found it, nor does he know who has got it; and we cannot say
whether it will appear or not; and so, on that head, as some say that no
second part has ever been good, and others that enough has been already
written about Don Quixote, it is thought there will be no second part;
though some, who are jovial rather than saturnine, say, ‘Let us have
more Quixotades, let Don Quixote charge and Sancho chatter, and no matter
what it may turn out, we shall be satisfied with that.’”
</p>
<p>
“And what does the author mean to do?” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“What?” replied Samson; “why, as soon as he has found
the history which he is now searching for with extraordinary diligence, he
will at once give it to the press, moved more by the profit that may
accrue to him from doing so than by any thought of praise.”
</p>
<p>
Whereat Sancho observed, “The author looks for money and profit,
does he? It will be a wonder if he succeeds, for it will be only hurry,
hurry, with him, like the tailor on Easter Eve; and works done in a hurry
are never finished as perfectly as they ought to be. Let master Moor, or
whatever he is, pay attention to what he is doing, and I and my master
will give him as much grouting ready to his hand, in the way of adventures
and accidents of all sorts, as would make up not only one second part, but
a hundred. The good man fancies, no doubt, that we are fast asleep in the
straw here, but let him hold up our feet to be shod and he will see which
foot it is we go lame on. All I say is, that if my master would take my
advice, we would be now afield, redressing outrages and righting wrongs,
as is the use and custom of good knights-errant.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho had hardly uttered these words when the neighing of Rocinante fell
upon their ears, which neighing Don Quixote accepted as a happy omen, and
he resolved to make another sally in three or four days from that time.
Announcing his intention to the bachelor, he asked his advice as to the
quarter in which he ought to commence his expedition, and the bachelor
replied that in his opinion he ought to go to the kingdom of Aragon, and
the city of Saragossa, where there were to be certain solemn joustings at
the festival of St. George, at which he might win renown above all the
knights of Aragon, which would be winning it above all the knights of the
world. He commended his very praiseworthy and gallant resolution, but
admonished him to proceed with greater caution in encountering dangers,
because his life did not belong to him, but to all those who had need of
him to protect and aid them in their misfortunes.
</p>
<p>
“There’s where it is, what I abominate, Señor Samson,”
said Sancho here; “my master will attack a hundred armed men as a
greedy boy would half a dozen melons. Body of the world, señor bachelor!
there is a time to attack and a time to retreat, and it is not to be
always ‘Santiago, and close Spain!’ Moreover, I have heard it
said (and I think by my master himself, if I remember rightly) that the
mean of valour lies between the extremes of cowardice and rashness; and if
that be so, I don’t want him to fly without having good reason, or
to attack when the odds make it better not. But, above all things, I warn
my master that if he is to take me with him it must be on the condition
that he is to do all the fighting, and that I am not to be called upon to
do anything except what concerns keeping him clean and comfortable; in
this I will dance attendance on him readily; but to expect me to draw
sword, even against rascally churls of the hatchet and hood, is idle. I
don’t set up to be a fighting man, Señor Samson, but only the best
and most loyal squire that ever served knight-errant; and if my master Don
Quixote, in consideration of my many faithful services, is pleased to give
me some island of the many his worship says one may stumble on in these
parts, I will take it as a great favour; and if he does not give it to me,
I was born like everyone else, and a man must not live in dependence on
anyone except God; and what is more, my bread will taste as well, and
perhaps even better, without a government than if I were a governor; and
how do I know but that in these governments the devil may have prepared
some trip for me, to make me lose my footing and fall and knock my
grinders out? Sancho I was born and Sancho I mean to die. But for all
that, if heaven were to make me a fair offer of an island or something
else of the kind, without much trouble and without much risk, I am not
such a fool as to refuse it; for they say, too, ‘when they offer
thee a heifer, run with a halter; and ‘when good luck comes to thee,
take it in.’”
</p>
<p>
“Brother Sancho,” said Carrasco, “you have spoken like a
professor; but, for all that, put your trust in God and in Señor Don
Quixote, for he will give you a kingdom, not to say an island.”
</p>
<p>
“It is all the same, be it more or be it less,” replied
Sancho; “though I can tell Señor Carrasco that my master would not
throw the kingdom he might give me into a sack all in holes; for I have
felt my own pulse and I find myself sound enough to rule kingdoms and
govern islands; and I have before now told my master as much.”
</p>
<p>
“Take care, Sancho,” said Samson; “honours change
manners, and perhaps when you find yourself a governor you won’t
know the mother that bore you.”
</p>
<p>
“That may hold good of those that are born in the ditches,”
said Sancho, “not of those who have the fat of an old Christian four
fingers deep on their souls, as I have. Nay, only look at my disposition,
is that likely to show ingratitude to anyone?”
</p>
<p>
“God grant it,” said Don Quixote; “we shall see when the
government comes; and I seem to see it already.”
</p>
<p>
He then begged the bachelor, if he were a poet, to do him the favour of
composing some verses for him conveying the farewell he meant to take of
his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, and to see that a letter of her name was
placed at the beginning of each line, so that, at the end of the verses,
“Dulcinea del Toboso” might be read by putting together the
first letters. The bachelor replied that although he was not one of the
famous poets of Spain, who were, they said, only three and a half, he
would not fail to compose the required verses; though he saw a great
difficulty in the task, as the letters which made up the name were
seventeen; so, if he made four ballad stanzas of four lines each, there
would be a letter over, and if he made them of five, what they called
decimas or redondillas, there were three letters short; nevertheless he
would try to drop a letter as well as he could, so that the name “Dulcinea
del Toboso” might be got into four ballad stanzas.
</p>
<p>
“It must be, by some means or other,” said Don Quixote,
“for unless the name stands there plain and manifest, no woman would
believe the verses were made for her.”
</p>
<p>
They agreed upon this, and that the departure should take place in three
days from that time. Don Quixote charged the bachelor to keep it a secret,
especially from the curate and Master Nicholas, and from his niece and the
housekeeper, lest they should prevent the execution of his praiseworthy
and valiant purpose. Carrasco promised all, and then took his leave,
charging Don Quixote to inform him of his good or evil fortunes whenever
he had an opportunity; and thus they bade each other farewell, and Sancho
went away to make the necessary preparations for their expedition.
