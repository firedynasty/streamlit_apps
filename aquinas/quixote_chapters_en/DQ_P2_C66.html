As he left Barcelona, Don Quixote turned gaze upon the spot where he had
fallen. “Here Troy was,” said he; “here my ill-luck, not
my cowardice, robbed me of all the glory I had won; here Fortune made me
the victim of her caprices; here the lustre of my achievements was dimmed;
here, in a word, fell my happiness never to rise again.”
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
<img alt="p66b.jpg (251K)" src="images/p66b.jpg" style="width:100%;" id="img_images_p66b.jpg">

</p>
<p>
“Señor,” said Sancho on hearing this, “it is the part of
brave hearts to be patient in adversity just as much as to be glad in
prosperity; I judge by myself, for, if when I was a governor I was glad,
now that I am a squire and on foot I am not sad; and I have heard say that
she whom commonly they call Fortune is a drunken whimsical jade, and, what
is more, blind, and therefore neither sees what she does, nor knows whom
she casts down or whom she sets up.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou art a great philosopher, Sancho,” said Don Quixote;
“thou speakest very sensibly; I know not who taught thee. But I can
tell thee there is no such thing as Fortune in the world, nor does
anything which takes place there, be it good or bad, come about by chance,
but by the special preordination of heaven; and hence the common saying
that ‘each of us is the maker of his own Fortune.’ I have been
that of mine; but not with the proper amount of prudence, and my
self-confidence has therefore made me pay dearly; for I ought to have
reflected that Rocinante’s feeble strength could not resist the
mighty bulk of the Knight of the White Moon’s horse. In a word, I
ventured it, I did my best, I was overthrown, but though I lost my honour
I did not lose nor can I lose the virtue of keeping my word. When I was a
knight-errant, daring and valiant, I supported my achievements by hand and
deed, and now that I am a humble squire I will support my words by keeping
the promise I have given. Forward then, Sancho my friend, let us go to
keep the year of the novitiate in our own country, and in that seclusion
we shall pick up fresh strength to return to the by me never-forgotten
calling of arms.”
</p>
<p>
“Señor,” returned Sancho, “travelling on foot is not
such a pleasant thing that it makes me feel disposed or tempted to make
long marches. Let us leave this armour hung up on some tree, instead of
someone that has been hanged; and then with me on Dapple’s back and
my feet off the ground we will arrange the stages as your worship pleases
to measure them out; but to suppose that I am going to travel on foot, and
make long ones, is to suppose nonsense.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou sayest well, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “let my
armour be hung up for a trophy, and under it or round it we will carve on
the trees what was inscribed on the trophy of Roland’s armour-
</p>
<p class="poem">
These let none move<br>
Who dareth not his might with Roland prove.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s the very thing,” said Sancho; “and if it
was not that we should feel the want of Rocinante on the road, it would be
as well to leave him hung up too.”
</p>
<p>
“And yet, I had rather not have either him or the armour hung up,”
said Don Quixote, “that it may not be said, ‘for good service
a bad return.’”
</p>
<p>
“Your worship is right,” said Sancho; “for, as sensible
people hold, ‘the fault of the ass must not be laid on the
pack-saddle;’ and, as in this affair the fault is your worship’s,
punish yourself and don’t let your anger break out against the
already battered and bloody armour, or the meekness of Rocinante, or the
tenderness of my feet, trying to make them travel more than is reasonable.”
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

</p>
<p>
In converse of this sort the whole of that day went by, as did the four
succeeding ones, without anything occurring to interrupt their journey,
but on the fifth as they entered a village they found a great number of
people at the door of an inn enjoying themselves, as it was a holiday.
Upon Don Quixote’s approach a peasant called out, “One of
these two gentlemen who come here, and who don’t know the parties,
will tell us what we ought to do about our wager.”
</p>
<p>
“That I will, certainly,” said Don Quixote, “and
according to the rights of the case, if I can manage to understand it.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, here it is, worthy sir,” said the peasant; “a man
of this village who is so fat that he weighs twenty stone challenged
another, a neighbour of his, who does not weigh more than nine, to run a
race. The agreement was that they were to run a distance of a hundred
paces with equal weights; and when the challenger was asked how the
weights were to be equalised he said that the other, as he weighed nine
stone, should put eleven in iron on his back, and that in this way the
twenty stone of the thin man would equal the twenty stone of the fat one.”
</p>
<p>
“Not at all,” exclaimed Sancho at once, before Don Quixote
could answer; “it’s for me, that only a few days ago left off
being a governor and a judge, as all the world knows, to settle these
doubtful questions and give an opinion in disputes of all sorts.”
</p>
<p>
“Answer in God’s name, Sancho my friend,” said Don
Quixote, “for I am not fit to give crumbs to a cat, my wits are so
confused and upset.”
</p>
<p>
With this permission Sancho said to the peasants who stood clustered round
him, waiting with open mouths for the decision to come from his, “Brothers,
what the fat man requires is not in reason, nor has it a shadow of justice
in it; because, if it be true, as they say, that the challenged may choose
the weapons, the other has no right to choose such as will prevent and
keep him from winning. My decision, therefore, is that the fat challenger
prune, peel, thin, trim and correct himself, and take eleven stone of his
flesh off his body, here or there, as he pleases, and as suits him best;
and being in this way reduced to nine stone weight, he will make himself
equal and even with nine stone of his opponent, and they will be able to
run on equal terms.”
</p>
<p>
“By all that’s good,” said one of the peasants as he
heard Sancho’s decision, “but the gentleman has spoken like a
saint, and given judgment like a canon! But I’ll be bound the fat
man won’t part with an ounce of his flesh, not to say eleven stone.”
</p>
<p>
“The best plan will be for them not to run,” said another,
“so that neither the thin man break down under the weight, nor the
fat one strip himself of his flesh; let half the wager be spent in wine,
and let’s take these gentlemen to the tavern where there’s the
best, and ‘over me be the cloak when it rains.’”
</p>
<p>
“I thank you, sirs,” said Don Quixote; “but I cannot
stop for an instant, for sad thoughts and unhappy circumstances force me
to seem discourteous and to travel apace;” and spurring Rocinante he
pushed on, leaving them wondering at what they had seen and heard, at his
own strange figure and at the shrewdness of his servant, for such they
took Sancho to be; and another of them observed, “If the servant is
so clever, what must the master be? I’ll bet, if they are going to
Salamanca to study, they’ll come to be alcaldes of the Court in a
trice; for it’s a mere joke—only to read and read, and have
interest and good luck; and before a man knows where he is he finds
himself with a staff in his hand or a mitre on his head.”
</p>
<p>
That night master and man passed out in the fields in the open air, and
the next day as they were pursuing their journey they saw coming towards
them a man on foot with alforjas at the neck and a javelin or spiked staff
in his hand, the very cut of a foot courier; who, as soon as he came close
to Don Quixote, increased his pace and half running came up to him, and
embracing his right thigh, for he could reach no higher, exclaimed with
evident pleasure, “O Señor Don Quixote of La Mancha, what happiness
it will be to the heart of my lord the duke when he knows your worship is
coming back to his castle, for he is still there with my lady the duchess!”
</p>
<p>
“I do not recognise you, friend,” said Don Quixote, “nor
do I know who you are, unless you tell me.”
</p>
<p>
“I am Tosilos, my lord the duke’s lacquey, Señor Don Quixote,”
replied the courier; “he who refused to fight your worship about
marrying the daughter of Doña Rodriguez.”
</p>
<p>
“God bless me!” exclaimed Don Quixote; “is it possible
that you are the one whom mine enemies the enchanters changed into the
lacquey you speak of in order to rob me of the honour of that battle?”
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense, good sir!” said the messenger; “there was no
enchantment or transformation at all; I entered the lists just as much
lacquey Tosilos as I came out of them lacquey Tosilos. I thought to marry
without fighting, for the girl had taken my fancy; but my scheme had a
very different result, for as soon as your worship had left the castle my
lord the duke had a hundred strokes of the stick given me for having acted
contrary to the orders he gave me before engaging in the combat; and the
end of the whole affair is that the girl has become a nun, and Doña
Rodriguez has gone back to Castile, and I am now on my way to Barcelona
with a packet of letters for the viceroy which my master is sending him.
If your worship would like a drop, sound though warm, I have a gourd here
full of the best, and some scraps of Tronchon cheese that will serve as a
provocative and wakener of your thirst if so be it is asleep.”
</p>
<p>
“I take the offer,” said Sancho; “no more compliments
about it; pour out, good Tosilos, in spite of all the enchanters in the
Indies.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou art indeed the greatest glutton in the world, Sancho,”
said Don Quixote, “and the greatest booby on earth, not to be able
to see that this courier is enchanted and this Tosilos a sham one; stop
with him and take thy fill; I will go on slowly and wait for thee to come
up with me.”
</p>
<p>
The lacquey laughed, unsheathed his gourd, unwalletted his scraps, and
taking out a small loaf of bread he and Sancho seated themselves on the
green grass, and in peace and good fellowship finished off the contents of
the alforjas down to the bottom, so resolutely that they licked the
wrapper of the letters, merely because it smelt of cheese.
</p>
<p>
Said Tosilos to Sancho, “Beyond a doubt, Sancho my friend, this
master of thine ought to be a madman.”
</p>
<p>
“Ought!” said Sancho; “he owes no man anything; he pays
for everything, particularly when the coin is madness. I see it plain
enough, and I tell him so plain enough; but what’s the use?
especially now that it is all over with him, for here he is beaten by the
Knight of the White Moon.”
</p>
<p>
Tosilos begged him to explain what had happened him, but Sancho replied
that it would not be good manners to leave his master waiting for him; and
that some other day if they met there would be time enough for that; and
then getting up, after shaking his doublet and brushing the crumbs out of
his beard, he drove Dapple on before him, and bidding adieu to Tosilos
left him and rejoined his master, who was waiting for him under the shade
of a tree.
