OF THE DELECTABLE DISCOURSE WHICH THE DUCHESS AND HER DAMSELS HELD WITH

<p>
The history records that Sancho did not sleep that afternoon, but in order
to keep his word came, before he had well done dinner, to visit the
duchess, who, finding enjoyment in listening to him, made him sit down
beside her on a low seat, though Sancho, out of pure good breeding, wanted
not to sit down; the duchess, however, told him he was to sit down as
governor and talk as squire, as in both respects he was worthy of even the
chair of the Cid Ruy Diaz the Campeador. Sancho shrugged his shoulders,
obeyed, and sat down, and all the duchess’s damsels and duennas
gathered round him, waiting in profound silence to hear what he would say.
It was the duchess, however, who spoke first, saying:
</p>
<p>
“Now that we are alone, and that there is nobody here to overhear
us, I should be glad if the señor governor would relieve me of certain
doubts I have, rising out of the history of the great Don Quixote that is
now in print. One is: inasmuch as worthy Sancho never saw Dulcinea, I mean
the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, nor took Don Quixote’s letter to her,
for it was left in the memorandum book in the Sierra Morena, how did he
dare to invent the answer and all that about finding her sifting wheat,
the whole story being a deception and falsehood, and so much to the
prejudice of the peerless Dulcinea’s good name, a thing that is not
at all becoming the character and fidelity of a good squire?”
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
<img alt="p33b.jpg (326K)" src="images/p33b.jpg" style="width:100%;" id="img_images_p33b.jpg">
</div>
<p>
<a href="images/p33b.jpg" style="width:100%;" id="id-7032793620118043074"><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg" id="img_images_enlarge.jpg_181"></a><br><br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
At these words, Sancho, without uttering one in reply, got up from his
chair, and with noiseless steps, with his body bent and his finger on his
lips, went all round the room lifting up the hangings; and this done, he
came back to his seat and said, “Now, señora, that I have seen that
there is no one except the bystanders listening to us on the sly, I will
answer what you have asked me, and all you may ask me, without fear or
dread. And the first thing I have got to say is, that for my own part I
hold my master Don Quixote to be stark mad, though sometimes he says
things that, to my mind, and indeed everybody’s that listens to him,
are so wise, and run in such a straight furrow, that Satan himself could
not have said them better; but for all that, really, and beyond all
question, it’s my firm belief he is cracked. Well, then, as this is
clear to my mind, I can venture to make him believe things that have
neither head nor tail, like that affair of the answer to the letter, and
that other of six or eight days ago, which is not yet in history, that is
to say, the affair of the enchantment of my lady Dulcinea; for I made him
believe she is enchanted, though there’s no more truth in it than
over the hills of Úbeda.”
</p>
<p>
The duchess begged him to tell her about the enchantment or deception, so
Sancho told the whole story exactly as it had happened, and his hearers
were not a little amused by it; and then resuming, the duchess said,
“In consequence of what worthy Sancho has told me, a doubt starts up
in my mind, and there comes a kind of whisper to my ear that says, ‘If
Don Quixote be mad, crazy, and cracked, and Sancho Panza his squire knows
it, and, notwithstanding, serves and follows him, and goes trusting to his
empty promises, there can be no doubt he must be still madder and sillier
than his master; and that being so, it will be cast in your teeth, señora
duchess, if you give the said Sancho an island to govern; for how will he
who does not know how to govern himself know how to govern others?’”
</p>
<p>
“By God, señora,” said Sancho, “but that doubt comes
timely; but your grace may say it out, and speak plainly, or as you like;
for I know what you say is true, and if I were wise I should have left my
master long ago; but this was my fate, this was my bad luck; I can’t
help it, I must follow him; we’re from the same village, I’ve
eaten his bread, I’m fond of him, I’m grateful, he gave me his
ass-colts, and above all I’m faithful; so it’s quite
impossible for anything to separate us, except the pickaxe and shovel. And
if your highness does not like to give me the government you promised, God
made me without it, and maybe your not giving it to me will be all the
better for my conscience, for fool as I am I know the proverb ‘to
her hurt the ant got wings,’ and it may be that Sancho the squire
will get to heaven sooner than Sancho the governor. ‘They make as
good bread here as in France,’ and ‘by night all cats are
grey,’ and ‘a hard case enough his, who hasn’t broken
his fast at two in the afternoon,’ and ‘there’s no
stomach a hand’s breadth bigger than another,’ and the same
can be filled ‘with straw or hay,’ as the saying is, and
‘the little birds of the field have God for their purveyor and
caterer,’ and ‘four yards of Cuenca frieze keep one warmer
than four of Segovia broad-cloth,’ and ‘when we quit this
world and are put underground the prince travels by as narrow a path as
the journeyman,’ and ‘the Pope’s body does not take up
more feet of earth than the sacristan’s,’ for all that the one
is higher than the other; for when we go to our graves we all pack
ourselves up and make ourselves small, or rather they pack us up and make
us small in spite of us, and then—good night to us. And I say once
more, if your ladyship does not like to give me the island because I’m
a fool, like a wise man I will take care to give myself no trouble about
it; I have heard say that ‘behind the cross there’s the devil,’
and that ‘all that glitters is not gold,’ and that from among
the oxen, and the ploughs, and the yokes, Wamba the husbandman was taken
to be made King of Spain, and from among brocades, and pleasures, and
riches, Roderick was taken to be devoured by adders, if the verses of the
old ballads don’t lie.”
</p>
<p>
“To be sure they don’t lie!” exclaimed Doña Rodriguez,
the duenna, who was one of the listeners. “Why, there’s a
ballad that says they put King Rodrigo alive into a tomb full of toads,
and adders, and lizards, and that two days afterwards the king, in a
plaintive, feeble voice, cried out from within the tomb-
</p>
<p class="poem">
They gnaw me now, they gnaw me now,<br>
There where I most did sin.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
And according to that the gentleman has good reason to say he would rather
be a labouring man than a king, if vermin are to eat him.”
</p>
<p>
The duchess could not help laughing at the simplicity of her duenna, or
wondering at the language and proverbs of Sancho, to whom she said,
“Worthy Sancho knows very well that when once a knight has made a
promise he strives to keep it, though it should cost him his life. My lord
and husband the duke, though not one of the errant sort, is none the less
a knight for that reason, and will keep his word about the promised
island, in spite of the envy and malice of the world. Let Sancho be of
good cheer; for when he least expects it he will find himself seated on
the throne of his island and seat of dignity, and will take possession of
his government that he may discard it for another of three-bordered
brocade. The charge I give him is to be careful how he governs his
vassals, bearing in mind that they are all loyal and well-born.”
</p>
<p>
“As to governing them well,” said Sancho, “there’s
no need of charging me to do that, for I’m kind-hearted by nature,
and full of compassion for the poor; there’s no stealing the loaf
from him who kneads and bakes;’ and by my faith it won’t do to
throw false dice with me; I am an old dog, and I know all about ‘tus,
tus;’ I can be wide-awake if need be, and I don’t let clouds
come before my eyes, for I know where the shoe pinches me; I say so,
because with me the good will have support and protection, and the bad
neither footing nor access. And it seems to me that, in governments, to
make a beginning is everything; and maybe, after having been governor a
fortnight, I’ll take kindly to the work and know more about it than
the field labour I have been brought up to.”
</p>
<p>
“You are right, Sancho,” said the duchess, “for no one
is born ready taught, and the bishops are made out of men and not out of
stones. But to return to the subject we were discussing just now, the
enchantment of the lady Dulcinea, I look upon it as certain, and something
more than evident, that Sancho’s idea of practising a deception upon
his master, making him believe that the peasant girl was Dulcinea and that
if he did not recognise her it must be because she was enchanted, was all
a device of one of the enchanters that persecute Don Quixote. For in truth
and earnest, I know from good authority that the coarse country wench who
jumped up on the ass was and is Dulcinea del Toboso, and that worthy
Sancho, though he fancies himself the deceiver, is the one that is
deceived; and that there is no more reason to doubt the truth of this,
than of anything else we never saw. Señor Sancho Panza must know that we
too have enchanters here that are well disposed to us, and tell us what
goes on in the world, plainly and distinctly, without subterfuge or
deception; and believe me, Sancho, that agile country lass was and is
Dulcinea del Toboso, who is as much enchanted as the mother that bore her;
and when we least expect it, we shall see her in her own proper form, and
then Sancho will be disabused of the error he is under at present.”
</p>
<p>
“All that’s very possible,” said Sancho Panza; “and
now I’m willing to believe what my master says about what he saw in
the cave of Montesinos, where he says he saw the lady Dulcinea del Toboso
in the very same dress and apparel that I said I had seen her in when I
enchanted her all to please myself. It must be all exactly the other way,
as your ladyship says; because it is impossible to suppose that out of my
poor wit such a cunning trick could be concocted in a moment, nor do I
think my master is so mad that by my weak and feeble persuasion he could
be made to believe a thing so out of all reason. But, señora, your
excellence must not therefore think me ill-disposed, for a dolt like me is
not bound to see into the thoughts and plots of those vile enchanters. I
invented all that to escape my master’s scolding, and not with any
intention of hurting him; and if it has turned out differently, there is a
God in heaven who judges our hearts.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” said the duchess; “but tell me, Sancho,
what is this you say about the cave of Montesinos, for I should like to
know.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho upon this related to her, word for word, what has been said already
touching that adventure, and having heard it the duchess said, “From
this occurrence it may be inferred that, as the great Don Quixote says he
saw there the same country wench Sancho saw on the way from El Toboso, it
is, no doubt, Dulcinea, and that there are some very active and
exceedingly busy enchanters about.”
</p>
<p>
“So I say,” said Sancho, “and if my lady Dulcinea is
enchanted, so much the worse for her, and I’m not going to pick a
quarrel with my master’s enemies, who seem to be many and spiteful.
The truth is that the one I saw was a country wench, and I set her down to
be a country wench; and if that was Dulcinea it must not be laid at my
door, nor should I be called to answer for it or take the consequences.
But they must go nagging at me at every step—‘Sancho said it,
Sancho did it, Sancho here, Sancho there,’ as if Sancho was nobody
at all, and not that same Sancho Panza that’s now going all over the
world in books, so Samson Carrasco told me, and he’s at any rate one
that’s a bachelor of Salamanca; and people of that sort can’t
lie, except when the whim seizes them or they have some very good reason
for it. So there’s no occasion for anybody to quarrel with me; and
then I have a good character, and, as I have heard my master say, ‘a
good name is better than great riches;’ let them only stick me into
this government and they’ll see wonders, for one who has been a good
squire will be a good governor.”
</p>
<p>
“All worthy Sancho’s observations,” said the duchess,
“are Catonian sentences, or at any rate out of the very heart of
Michael Verino himself, who <i>florentibus occidit annis</i>. In fact, to speak
in his own style, ‘under a bad cloak there’s often a good
drinker.’”
</p>
<p>
“Indeed, señora,” said Sancho, “I never yet drank out of
wickedness; from thirst I have very likely, for I have nothing of the
hypocrite in me; I drink when I’m inclined, or, if I’m not
inclined, when they offer it to me, so as not to look either strait-laced
or ill-bred; for when a friend drinks one’s health what heart can be
so hard as not to return it? But if I put on my shoes I don’t dirty
them; besides, squires to knights-errant mostly drink water, for they are
always wandering among woods, forests and meadows, mountains and crags,
without a drop of wine to be had if they gave their eyes for it.”
</p>
<p>
“So I believe,” said the duchess; “and now let Sancho go
and take his sleep, and we will talk by-and-by at greater length, and
settle how he may soon go and stick himself into the government, as he
says.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho once more kissed the duchess’s hand, and entreated her to let
good care be taken of his Dapple, for he was the light of his eyes.
</p>
<p>
“What is Dapple?” said the duchess.
</p>
<p>
“My ass,” said Sancho, “which, not to mention him by
that name, I’m accustomed to call Dapple; I begged this lady duenna
here to take care of him when I came into the castle, and she got as angry
as if I had said she was ugly or old, though it ought to be more natural
and proper for duennas to feed asses than to ornament chambers. God bless
me! what a spite a gentleman of my village had against these ladies!”
</p>
<p>
“He must have been some clown,” said Doña Rodriguez the
duenna; “for if he had been a gentleman and well-born he would have
exalted them higher than the horns of the moon.”
</p>
<p>
“That will do,” said the duchess; “no more of this;
hush, Doña Rodriguez, and let Señor Panza rest easy and leave the
treatment of Dapple in my charge, for as he is a treasure of Sancho’s,
I’ll put him on the apple of my eye.”
</p>
<p>
“It will be enough for him to be in the stable,” said Sancho,
“for neither he nor I are worthy to rest a moment in the apple of
your highness’s eye, and I’d as soon stab myself as consent to
it; for though my master says that in civilities it is better to lose by a
card too many than a card too few, when it comes to civilities to asses we
must mind what we are about and keep within due bounds.”
</p>
<p>
“Take him to your government, Sancho,” said the duchess,
“and there you will be able to make as much of him as you like, and
even release him from work and pension him off.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t think, señora duchess, that you have said anything
absurd,” said Sancho; “I have seen more than two asses go to
governments, and for me to take mine with me would be nothing new.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho’s words made the duchess laugh again and gave her fresh
amusement, and dismissing him to sleep she went away to tell the duke the
conversation she had had with him, and between them they plotted and
arranged to play a joke upon Don Quixote that was to be a rare one and
entirely in knight-errantry style, and in that same style they practised
several upon him, so much in keeping and so clever that they form the best
adventures this great history contains.
