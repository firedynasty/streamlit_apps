<h3>
<a id="ch73b"></a>CHAPTER LXXIII.<br>
OF THE OMENS DON QUIXOTE HAD AS HE ENTERED HIS OWN VILLAGE, AND OTHER
INCIDENTS THAT EMBELLISH AND GIVE A COLOUR TO THIS GREAT HISTORY
</h3>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
<img alt="p73a.jpg (141K)" src="images/p73a.jpg" style="width:100%;" id="img_images_p73a.jpg">

<p>
<a href="images/p73a.jpg" style="width:100%;" id="id-956652695393177808"><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg" id="img_images_enlarge.jpg_257"></a><br><br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
At the entrance of the village, so says Cide Hamete, Don Quixote saw two
boys quarrelling on the village threshing-floor, one of whom said to the
other, “Take it easy, Periquillo; thou shalt never see it again as
long as thou livest.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote heard this, and said he to Sancho, “Dost thou not mark,
friend, what that boy said, ‘Thou shalt never see it again as long
as thou livest’?”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Sancho, “what does it matter if the boy
said so?”
</p>
<p>
“What!” said Don Quixote, “dost thou not see that,
applied to the object of my desires, the words mean that I am never to see
Dulcinea more?”
</p>
<p>
Sancho was about to answer, when his attention was diverted by seeing a hare
come flying across the plain pursued by several greyhounds and sportsmen. In
its terror it ran to take shelter and hide itself under Dapple. Sancho caught
it alive and presented it to Don Quixote, who was saying, “<i>Malum
signum, malum signum!</i> a hare flies, greyhounds chase it, Dulcinea appears
not.”
</p>
<p>
“Your worship’s a strange man,” said Sancho; “let’s
take it for granted that this hare is Dulcinea, and these greyhounds
chasing it the malignant enchanters who turned her into a country wench;
she flies, and I catch her and put her into your worship’s hands,
and you hold her in your arms and cherish her; what bad sign is that, or
what ill omen is there to be found here?”
</p>
<p>
The two boys who had been quarrelling came over to look at the hare, and
Sancho asked one of them what their quarrel was about. He was answered by
the one who had said, “Thou shalt never see it again as long as thou
livest,” that he had taken a cage full of crickets from the other
boy, and did not mean to give it back to him as long as he lived. Sancho
took out four cuartos from his pocket and gave them to the boy for the
cage, which he placed in Don Quixote’s hands, saying, “There,
señor! there are the omens broken and destroyed, and they have no more to
do with our affairs, to my thinking, fool as I am, than with last year’s
clouds; and if I remember rightly I have heard the curate of our village
say that it does not become Christians or sensible people to give any heed
to these silly things; and even you yourself said the same to me some time
ago, telling me that all Christians who minded omens were fools; but there’s
no need of making words about it; let us push on and go into our village.”
</p>
<p>
The sportsmen came up and asked for their hare, which Don Quixote gave
them. They then went on, and upon the green at the entrance of the town
they came upon the curate and the bachelor Samson Carrasco busy with their
breviaries. It should be mentioned that Sancho had thrown, by way of a
sumpter-cloth, over Dapple and over the bundle of armour, the buckram robe
painted with flames which they had put upon him at the duke’s castle
the night Altisidora came back to life. He had also fixed the mitre on
Dapple’s head, the oddest transformation and decoration that ever
ass in the world underwent. They were at once recognised by both the
curate and the bachelor, who came towards them with open arms. Don Quixote
dismounted and received them with a close embrace; and the boys, who are
lynxes that nothing escapes, spied out the ass’s mitre and came
running to see it, calling out to one another, “Come here, boys, and
see Sancho Panza’s ass figged out finer than Mingo, and Don Quixote’s
beast leaner than ever.”
</p>
<p>
So at length, with the boys capering round them, and accompanied by the
curate and the bachelor, they made their entrance into the town, and
proceeded to Don Quixote’s house, at the door of which they found
his housekeeper and niece, whom the news of his arrival had already
reached. It had been brought to Teresa Panza, Sancho’s wife, as
well, and she with her hair all loose and half naked, dragging Sanchica
her daughter by the hand, ran out to meet her husband; but seeing him
coming in by no means as good case as she thought a governor ought to be,
she said to him, “How is it you come this way, husband? It seems to
me you come tramping and footsore, and looking more like a disorderly
vagabond than a governor.”
</p>
<p>
“Hold your tongue, Teresa,” said Sancho; “often ‘where
there are pegs there are no flitches;’ let’s go into the house
and there you’ll hear strange things. I bring money, and that’s
the main thing, got by my own industry without wronging anybody.”
</p>
<p>
“You bring the money, my good husband,” said Teresa, “and
no matter whether it was got this way or that; for, however you may have
got it, you’ll not have brought any new practice into the world.”
</p>
<p>
Sanchica embraced her father and asked him if he brought her anything, for
she had been looking out for him as for the showers of May; and she taking
hold of him by the girdle on one side, and his wife by the hand, while the
daughter led Dapple, they made for their house, leaving Don Quixote in
his, in the hands of his niece and housekeeper, and in the company of the
curate and the bachelor.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote at once, without any regard to time or season, withdrew in
private with the bachelor and the curate, and in a few words told them of
his defeat, and of the engagement he was under not to quit his village for
a year, which he meant to keep to the letter without departing a hair’s
breadth from it, as became a knight-errant bound by scrupulous good faith
and the laws of knight-errantry; and of how he thought of turning shepherd
for that year, and taking his diversion in the solitude of the fields,
where he could with perfect freedom give range to his thoughts of love
while he followed the virtuous pastoral calling; and he besought them, if
they had not a great deal to do and were not prevented by more important
business, to consent to be his companions, for he would buy sheep enough
to qualify them for shepherds; and the most important point of the whole
affair, he could tell them, was settled, for he had given them names that
would fit them to a T. The curate asked what they were. Don Quixote
replied that he himself was to be called the shepherd Quixotize and the
bachelor the shepherd Carrascon, and the curate the shepherd Curambro, and
Sancho Panza the shepherd Pancino.
</p>
<p>
Both were astounded at Don Quixote’s new craze; however, lest he
should once more make off out of the village from them in pursuit of his
chivalry, they trusting that in the course of the year he might be cured,
fell in with his new project, applauded his crazy idea as a bright one,
and offered to share the life with him. “And what’s more,”
said Samson Carrasco, “I am, as all the world knows, a very famous
poet, and I’ll be always making verses, pastoral, or courtly, or as
it may come into my head, to pass away our time in those secluded regions
where we shall be roaming. But what is most needful, sirs, is that each of
us should choose the name of the shepherdess he means to glorify in his
verses, and that we should not leave a tree, be it ever so hard, without
writing up and carving her name on it, as is the habit and custom of
love-smitten shepherds.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s the very thing,” said Don Quixote; “though
I am relieved from looking for the name of an imaginary shepherdess, for
there’s the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, the glory of these
brooksides, the ornament of these meadows, the mainstay of beauty, the
cream of all the graces, and, in a word, the being to whom all praise is
appropriate, be it ever so hyperbolical.”
</p>
<p>
“Very true,” said the curate; “but we the others must
look about for accommodating shepherdesses that will answer our purpose
one way or another.”
</p>
<p>
“And,” added Samson Carrasco, “if they fail us, we can
call them by the names of the ones in print that the world is filled with,
Fílidas, Amarilises, Dianas, Fleridas, Galateas, Belisardas; for as they
sell them in the market-places we may fairly buy them and make them our
own. If my lady, or I should say my shepherdess, happens to be called Ana,
I’ll sing her praises under the name of Anarda, and if Francisca, I’ll
call her Francenia, and if Lucia, Lucinda, for it all comes to the same
thing; and Sancho Panza, if he joins this fraternity, may glorify his wife
Teresa Panza as Teresaina.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote laughed at the adaptation of the name, and the curate bestowed
vast praise upon the worthy and honourable resolution he had made, and
again offered to bear him company all the time that he could spare from
his imperative duties. And so they took their leave of him, recommending
and beseeching him to take care of his health and treat himself to a
suitable diet.
</p>
<p>
It so happened his niece and the housekeeper overheard all the three of
them said; and as soon as they were gone they both of them came in to Don
Quixote, and said the niece, “What’s this, uncle? Now that we
were thinking you had come back to stay at home and lead a quiet
respectable life there, are you going to get into fresh entanglements, and
turn ‘young shepherd, thou that comest here, young shepherd going
there?’ Nay! indeed ‘the straw is too hard now to make pipes
of.’”
</p>
<p>
“And,” added the housekeeper, “will your worship be able
to bear, out in the fields, the heats of summer, and the chills of winter,
and the howling of the wolves? Not you; for that’s a life and a
business for hardy men, bred and seasoned to such work almost from the
time they were in swaddling-clothes. Why, to make choice of evils, it’s
better to be a knight-errant than a shepherd! Look here, señor; take my
advice—and I’m not giving it to you full of bread and wine, but
fasting, and with fifty years upon my head—stay at home, look after your
affairs, go often to confession, be good to the poor, and upon my soul be
it if any evil comes to you.”
</p>
<p>
“Hold your peace, my daughters,” said Don Quixote; “I
know very well what my duty is; help me to bed, for I don’t feel
very well; and rest assured that, knight-errant now or wandering shepherd
to be, I shall never fail to have a care for your interests, as you will
see in the end.” And the good wenches (for that they undoubtedly
were), the housekeeper and niece, helped him to bed, where they gave him
something to eat and made him as comfortable as possible.
