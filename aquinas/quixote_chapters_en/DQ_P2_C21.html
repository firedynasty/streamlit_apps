IN WHICH CAMACHO’S WEDDING IS CONTINUED, WITH OTHER DELIGHTFUL

<p>
While Don Quixote and Sancho were engaged in the discussion set forth the
last chapter, they heard loud shouts and a great noise, which were uttered
and made by the men on the mares as they went at full gallop, shouting, to
receive the bride and bridegroom, who were approaching with musical
instruments and pageantry of all sorts around them, and accompanied by the
priest and the relatives of both, and all the most distinguished people of
the surrounding villages. When Sancho saw the bride, he exclaimed, “By
my faith, she is not dressed like a country girl, but like some fine court
lady; egad, as well as I can make out, the patena she wears rich coral,
and her green Cuenca stuff is thirty-pile velvet; and then the white linen
trimming—by my oath, but it’s satin! Look at her hands—jet
rings on them! May I never have luck if they’re not gold rings, and
real gold, and set with pearls as white as a curdled milk, and every one
of them worth an eye of one’s head! Whoreson baggage, what hair she
has! if it’s not a wig, I never saw longer or fairer all the days of
my life. See how bravely she bears herself—and her shape! Wouldn’t
you say she was like a walking palm tree loaded with clusters of dates?
for the trinkets she has hanging from her hair and neck look just like
them. I swear in my heart she is a brave lass, and fit ‘to pass over
the banks of Flanders.’”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote laughed at Sancho’s boorish eulogies and thought that,
saving his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, he had never seen a more beautiful
woman. The fair Quiteria appeared somewhat pale, which was, no doubt,
because of the bad night brides always pass dressing themselves out for
their wedding on the morrow. They advanced towards a theatre that stood on
one side of the meadow decked with carpets and boughs, where they were to
plight their troth, and from which they were to behold the dances and
plays; but at the moment of their arrival at the spot they heard a loud
outcry behind them, and a voice exclaiming, “Wait a little, ye, as
inconsiderate as ye are hasty!” At these words all turned round, and
perceived that the speaker was a man clad in what seemed to be a loose
black coat garnished with crimson patches like flames. He was crowned (as
was presently seen) with a crown of gloomy cypress, and in his hand he
held a long staff. As he approached he was recognised by everyone as the
gay Basilio, and all waited anxiously to see what would come of his words,
in dread of some catastrophe in consequence of his appearance at such a
moment. He came up at last weary and breathless, and planting himself in
front of the bridal pair, drove his staff, which had a steel spike at the
end, into the ground, and, with a pale face and eyes fixed on Quiteria, he
thus addressed her in a hoarse, trembling voice:
</p>
<p>
“Well dost thou know, ungrateful Quiteria, that according to the
holy law we acknowledge, so long as live thou canst take no husband; nor
art thou ignorant either that, in my hopes that time and my own exertions
would improve my fortunes, I have never failed to observe the respect due
to thy honour; but thou, casting behind thee all thou owest to my true
love, wouldst surrender what is mine to another whose wealth serves to
bring him not only good fortune but supreme happiness; and now to complete
it (not that I think he deserves it, but inasmuch as heaven is pleased to
bestow it upon him), I will, with my own hands, do away with the obstacle
that may interfere with it, and remove myself from between you. Long live
the rich Camacho! many a happy year may he live with the ungrateful
Quiteria! and let the poor Basilio die, Basilio whose poverty clipped the
wings of his happiness, and brought him to the grave!”
</p>
<p>
And so saying, he seized the staff he had driven into the ground, and
leaving one half of it fixed there, showed it to be a sheath that
concealed a tolerably long rapier; and, what may be called its hilt being
planted in the ground, he swiftly, coolly, and deliberately threw himself
upon it, and in an instant the bloody point and half the steel blade
appeared at his back, the unhappy man falling to the earth bathed in his
blood, and transfixed by his own weapon.
</p>
<p>
His friends at once ran to his aid, filled with grief at his misery and
sad fate, and Don Quixote, dismounting from Rocinante, hastened to support
him, and took him in his arms, and found he had not yet ceased to breathe.
They were about to draw out the rapier, but the priest who was standing by
objected to its being withdrawn before he had confessed him, as the
instant of its withdrawal would be that of this death. Basilio, however,
reviving slightly, said in a weak voice, as though in pain, “If thou
wouldst consent, cruel Quiteria, to give me thy hand as my bride in this
last fatal moment, I might still hope that my rashness would find pardon,
as by its means I attained the bliss of being thine.”
</p>
<p>
Hearing this the priest bade him think of the welfare of his soul rather
than of the cravings of the body, and in all earnestness implore God’s
pardon for his sins and for his rash resolve; to which Basilio replied
that he was determined not to confess unless Quiteria first gave him her
hand in marriage, for that happiness would compose his mind and give him
courage to make his confession.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote hearing the wounded man’s entreaty, exclaimed aloud that
what Basilio asked was just and reasonable, and moreover a request that
might be easily complied with; and that it would be as much to Señor
Camacho’s honour to receive the lady Quiteria as the widow of the
brave Basilio as if he received her direct from her father.
</p>
<p>
“In this case,” said he, “it will be only to say ‘yes,’
and no consequences can follow the utterance of the word, for the nuptial
couch of this marriage must be the grave.”
</p>
<p>
Camacho was listening to all this, perplexed and bewildered and not
knowing what to say or do; but so urgent were the entreaties of Basilio’s
friends, imploring him to allow Quiteria to give him her hand, so that his
soul, quitting this life in despair, should not be lost, that they moved,
nay, forced him, to say that if Quiteria were willing to give it he was
satisfied, as it was only putting off the fulfillment of his wishes for a
moment. At once all assailed Quiteria and pressed her, some with prayers,
and others with tears, and others with persuasive arguments, to give her
hand to poor Basilio; but she, harder than marble and more unmoved than
any statue, seemed unable or unwilling to utter a word, nor would she have
given any reply had not the priest bade her decide quickly what she meant
to do, as Basilio now had his soul at his teeth, and there was no time for
hesitation.
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
<img alt="p21b.jpg (374K)" src="images/p21b.jpg" style="width:100%;" id="img_images_p21b.jpg">
</div>
<p>
<a href="images/p21b.jpg" style="width:100%;" id="id-713231189585674301"><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg" id="img_images_enlarge.jpg_154"></a><br><br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
On this the fair Quiteria, to all appearance distressed, grieved, and
repentant, advanced without a word to where Basilio lay, his eyes already
turned in his head, his breathing short and painful, murmuring the name of
Quiteria between his teeth, and apparently about to die like a heathen and
not like a Christian. Quiteria approached him, and kneeling, demanded his
hand by signs without speaking. Basilio opened his eyes and gazing fixedly
at her, said, “O Quiteria, why hast thou turned compassionate at a
moment when thy compassion will serve as a dagger to rob me of life, for I
have not now the strength left either to bear the happiness thou givest me
in accepting me as thine, or to suppress the pain that is rapidly drawing
the dread shadow of death over my eyes? What I entreat of thee, O thou
fatal star to me, is that the hand thou demandest of me and wouldst give
me, be not given out of complaisance or to deceive me afresh, but that
thou confess and declare that without any constraint upon thy will thou
givest it to me as to thy lawful husband; for it is not meet that thou
shouldst trifle with me at such a moment as this, or have recourse to
falsehoods with one who has dealt so truly by thee.”
</p>
<p>
While uttering these words he showed such weakness that the bystanders
expected each return of faintness would take his life with it. Then
Quiteria, overcome with modesty and shame, holding in her right hand the
hand of Basilio, said, “No force would bend my will; as freely,
therefore, as it is possible for me to do so, I give thee the hand of a
lawful wife, and take thine if thou givest it to me of thine own free
will, untroubled and unaffected by the calamity thy hasty act has brought
upon thee.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I give it,” said Basilio, “not agitated or
distracted, but with unclouded reason that heaven is pleased to grant me,
thus do I give myself to be thy husband.”
</p>
<p>
“And I give myself to be thy wife,” said Quiteria, “whether
thou livest many years, or they carry thee from my arms to the grave.”
</p>
<p>
“For one so badly wounded,” observed Sancho at this point,
“this young man has a great deal to say; they should make him leave
off billing and cooing, and attend to his soul; for to my thinking he has
it more on his tongue than at his teeth.”
</p>
<p>
Basilio and Quiteria having thus joined hands, the priest, deeply moved
and with tears in his eyes, pronounced the blessing upon them, and
implored heaven to grant an easy passage to the soul of the newly wedded
man, who, the instant he received the blessing, started nimbly to his feet
and with unparalleled effrontery pulled out the rapier that had been
sheathed in his body. All the bystanders were astounded, and some, more
simple than inquiring, began shouting, “A miracle, a miracle!”
But Basilio replied, “No miracle, no miracle; only a trick, a trick!”
The priest, perplexed and amazed, made haste to examine the wound with
both hands, and found that the blade had passed, not through Basilio’s
flesh and ribs, but through a hollow iron tube full of blood, which he had
adroitly fixed at the place, the blood, as was afterwards ascertained,
having been so prepared as not to congeal. In short, the priest and
Camacho and most of those present saw they were tricked and made fools of.
The bride showed no signs of displeasure at the deception; on the
contrary, hearing them say that the marriage, being fraudulent, would not
be valid, she said that she confirmed it afresh, whence they all concluded
that the affair had been planned by agreement and understanding between
the pair, whereat Camacho and his supporters were so mortified that they
proceeded to revenge themselves by violence, and a great number of them
drawing their swords attacked Basilio, in whose protection as many more
swords were in an instant unsheathed, while Don Quixote taking the lead on
horseback, with his lance over his arm and well covered with his shield,
made all give way before him. Sancho, who never found any pleasure or
enjoyment in such doings, retreated to the wine-jars from which he had
taken his delectable skimmings, considering that, as a holy place, that
spot would be respected.
</p>
<p>
“Hold, sirs, hold!” cried Don Quixote in a loud voice; “we
have no right to take vengeance for wrongs that love may do to us:
remember love and war are the same thing, and as in war it is allowable
and common to make use of wiles and stratagems to overcome the enemy, so
in the contests and rivalries of love the tricks and devices employed to
attain the desired end are justifiable, provided they be not to the
discredit or dishonour of the loved object. Quiteria belonged to Basilio
and Basilio to Quiteria by the just and beneficent disposal of heaven.
Camacho is rich, and can purchase his pleasure when, where, and as it
pleases him. Basilio has but this ewe-lamb, and no one, however powerful
he may be, shall take her from him; these two whom God hath joined man
cannot separate; and he who attempts it must first pass the point of this
lance;” and so saying he brandished it so stoutly and dexterously
that he overawed all who did not know him.
</p>
<p>
But so deep an impression had the rejection of Quiteria made on Camacho’s
mind that it banished her at once from his thoughts; and so the counsels
of the priest, who was a wise and kindly disposed man, prevailed with him,
and by their means he and his partisans were pacified and tranquillised,
and to prove it put up their swords again, inveighing against the pliancy
of Quiteria rather than the craftiness of Basilio; Camacho maintaining
that, if Quiteria as a maiden had such a love for Basilio, she would have
loved him too as a married woman, and that he ought to thank heaven more
for having taken her than for having given her.
</p>
<p>
Camacho and those of his following, therefore, being consoled and
pacified, those on Basilio’s side were appeased; and the rich
Camacho, to show that he felt no resentment for the trick, and did not
care about it, desired the festival to go on just as if he were married in
reality. Neither Basilio, however, nor his bride, nor their followers
would take any part in it, and they withdrew to Basilio’s village;
for the poor, if they are persons of virtue and good sense, have those who
follow, honour, and uphold them, just as the rich have those who flatter
and dance attendance on them. With them they carried Don Quixote,
regarding him as a man of worth and a stout one. Sancho alone had a cloud
on his soul, for he found himself debarred from waiting for Camacho’s
splendid feast and festival, which lasted until night; and thus dragged
away, he moodily followed his master, who accompanied Basilio’s
party, and left behind him the flesh-pots of Egypt; though in his heart he
took them with him, and their now nearly finished skimmings that he
carried in the bucket conjured up visions before his eyes of the glory and
abundance of the good cheer he was losing. And so, vexed and dejected
though not hungry, without dismounting from Dapple he followed in the
footsteps of Rocinante.
