Don Quixote now felt it right to quit a life of such idleness as he was
leading in the castle; for he fancied that he was making himself sorely
missed by suffering himself to remain shut up and inactive amid the
countless luxuries and enjoyments his hosts lavished upon him as a knight,
and he felt too that he would have to render a strict account to heaven of
that indolence and seclusion; and so one day he asked the duke and duchess
to grant him permission to take his departure. They gave it, showing at
the same time that they were very sorry he was leaving them.
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

</p>
<p>
The duchess gave his wife’s letters to Sancho Panza, who shed tears
over them, saying, “Who would have thought that such grand hopes as
the news of my government bred in my wife Teresa Panza’s breast
would end in my going back now to the vagabond adventures of my master Don
Quixote of La Mancha? Still I’m glad to see my Teresa behaved as she
ought in sending the acorns, for if she had not sent them I’d have
been sorry, and she’d have shown herself ungrateful. It is a comfort
to me that they can’t call that present a bribe; for I had got the
government already when she sent them, and it’s but reasonable that
those who have had a good turn done them should show their gratitude, if
it’s only with a trifle. After all I went into the government naked,
and I come out of it naked; so I can say with a safe conscience—and
that’s no small matter—‘naked I was born, naked I find
myself, I neither lose nor gain.’”
</p>
<p>
Thus did Sancho soliloquise on the day of their departure, as Don Quixote,
who had the night before taken leave of the duke and duchess, coming out
made his appearance at an early hour in full armour in the courtyard of
the castle. The whole household of the castle were watching him from the
corridors, and the duke and duchess, too, came out to see him. Sancho was
mounted on his Dapple, with his alforjas, valise, and proven supremely
happy because the duke’s majordomo, the same that had acted the part
of the Trifaldi, had given him a little purse with two hundred gold crowns
to meet the necessary expenses of the road, but of this Don Quixote knew
nothing as yet. While all were, as has been said, observing him, suddenly
from among the duennas and handmaidens the impudent and witty Altisidora
lifted up her voice and said in pathetic tones:
</p>
<p class="poem">
Give ear, cruel knight;<br>
Draw rein; where’s the need<br>
Of spurring the flanks<br>
Of that ill-broken steed?<br>
From what art thou flying?<br>
No dragon I am,<br>
Not even a sheep,<br>
But a tender young lamb.<br>
Thou hast jilted a maiden<br>
As fair to behold<br>
As nymph of Diana<br>
Or Venus of old.<br>
Bireno, Æneas, what worse shall I call thee?<br>
Barabbas go with thee! All evil befall thee!<br>
<br>
In thy claws, ruthless robber,<br>
Thou bearest away<br>
The heart of a meek<br>
Loving maid for thy prey,<br>
Three kerchiefs thou stealest,<br>
And garters a pair,<br>
From legs than the whitest<br>
Of marble more fair;<br>
And the sighs that pursue thee<br>
Would burn to the ground<br>
Two thousand Troy Towns,<br>
If so many were found.<br>
Bireno, Æneas, what worse shall I call thee?<br>
Barabbas go with thee! All evil befall thee!<br>
<br>
May no bowels of mercy<br>
To Sancho be granted,<br>
And thy Dulcinea<br>
Be left still enchanted,<br>
May thy falsehood to me<br>
Find its punishment in her,<br>
For in my land the just<br>
Often pays for the sinner.<br>
May thy grandest adventures<br>
Discomfitures prove,<br>
May thy joys be all dreams,<br>
And forgotten thy love.<br>
Bireno, Æneas, what worse shall I call thee?<br>
Barabbas go with thee! All evil befall thee!<br>
<br>
May thy name be abhorred<br>
For thy conduct to ladies,<br>
From London to England,<br>
From Seville to Cadiz;<br>
May thy cards be unlucky,<br>
Thy hands contain ne’er a<br>
King, seven, or ace<br>
When thou playest primera;<br>
When thy corns are cut<br>
May it be to the quick;<br>
When thy grinders are drawn<br>
May the roots of them stick.<br>
Bireno, Æneas, what worse shall I call thee?<br>
Barabbas go with thee! All evil befall thee!<br>
</p>
<p>
All the while the unhappy Altisidora was bewailing herself in the above
strain Don Quixote stood staring at her; and without uttering a word in
reply to her he turned round to Sancho and said, “Sancho my friend,
I conjure thee by the life of thy forefathers tell me the truth; say, hast
thou by any chance taken the three kerchiefs and the garters this
love-sick maid speaks of?”
</p>
<p>
To this Sancho made answer, “The three kerchiefs I have; but the
garters, as much as ‘over the hills of Úbeda.’”
</p>
<p>
The duchess was amazed at Altisidora’s assurance; she knew that she
was bold, lively, and impudent, but not so much so as to venture to make
free in this fashion; and not being prepared for the joke, her
astonishment was all the greater. The duke had a mind to keep up the
sport, so he said, “It does not seem to me well done in you, sir
knight, that after having received the hospitality that has been offered
you in this very castle, you should have ventured to carry off even three
kerchiefs, not to say my handmaid’s garters. It shows a bad heart
and does not tally with your reputation. Restore her garters, or else I
defy you to mortal combat, for I am not afraid of rascally enchanters
changing or altering my features as they changed his who encountered you
into those of my lacquey, Tosilos.”
</p>
<p>
“God forbid,” said Don Quixote, “that I should draw my
sword against your illustrious person from which I have received such
great favours. The kerchiefs I will restore, as Sancho says he has them;
as to the garters that is impossible, for I have not got them, neither has
he; and if your handmaiden here will look in her hiding-places, depend
upon it she will find them. I have never been a thief, my lord duke, nor
do I mean to be so long as I live, if God cease not to have me in his
keeping. This damsel by her own confession speaks as one in love, for
which I am not to blame, and therefore need not ask pardon, either of her
or of your excellence, whom I entreat to have a better opinion of me, and
once more to give me leave to pursue my journey.”
</p>
<p>
“And may God so prosper it, Señor Don Quixote,” said the
duchess, “that we may always hear good news of your exploits; God
speed you; for the longer you stay, the more you inflame the hearts of the
damsels who behold you; and as for this one of mine, I will so chastise
her that she will not transgress again, either with her eyes or with her
words.”
</p>
<p>
“One word and no more, O valiant Don Quixote, I ask you to hear,”
said Altisidora, “and that is that I beg your pardon about the theft
of the garters; for by God and upon my soul I have got them on, and I have
fallen into the same blunder as he did who went looking for his ass being
all the while mounted on it.”
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t I say so?” said Sancho. “I’m a
likely one to hide thefts! Why if I wanted to deal in them, opportunities
came ready enough to me in my government.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote bowed his head, and saluted the duke and duchess and all the
bystanders, and wheeling Rocinante round, Sancho following him on Dapple,
he rode out of the castle, shaping his course for Saragossa.
