<p>
The duke and duchess were extremely glad to see how readily Don Quixote
fell in with their scheme; but at this moment Sancho observed, “I
hope this señora duenna won’t be putting any difficulties in the way
of the promise of my government; for I have heard a Toledo apothecary, who
talked like a goldfinch, say that where duennas were mixed up nothing good
could happen. God bless me, how he hated them, that same apothecary! And
so what I’m thinking is, if all duennas, of whatever sort or
condition they may be, are plagues and busybodies, what must they be that
are distressed, like this Countess Three-skirts or Three-tails!—for
in my country skirts or tails, tails or skirts, it’s all one.”
</p>
<p>
“Hush, friend Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “since this
lady duenna comes in quest of me from such a distant land she cannot be
one of those the apothecary meant; moreover this is a countess, and when
countesses serve as duennas it is in the service of queens and empresses,
for in their own houses they are mistresses paramount and have other
duennas to wait on them.”
</p>
<p>
To this Doña Rodriguez, who was present, made answer, “My lady the
duchess has duennas in her service that might be countesses if it was the
will of fortune; ‘but laws go as kings like;’ let nobody speak
ill of duennas, above all of ancient maiden ones; for though I am not one
myself, I know and am aware of the advantage a maiden duenna has over one
that is a widow; but ‘he who clipped us has kept the scissors.’”
</p>
<p>
“For all that,” said Sancho, “there’s so much to
be clipped about duennas, so my barber said, that ‘it will be better
not to stir the rice even though it sticks.’”
</p>
<p>
“These squires,” returned Doña Rodriguez, “are always
our enemies; and as they are the haunting spirits of the antechambers and
watch us at every step, whenever they are not saying their prayers (and
that’s often enough) they spend their time in tattling about us,
digging up our bones and burying our good name. But I can tell these
walking blocks that we will live in spite of them, and in great houses
too, though we die of hunger and cover our flesh, be it delicate or not,
with widow’s weeds, as one covers or hides a dunghill on a
procession day. By my faith, if it were permitted me and time allowed, I
could prove, not only to those here present, but to all the world, that
there is no virtue that is not to be found in a duenna.”
</p>
<p>
“I have no doubt,” said the duchess, “that my good Doña
Rodriguez is right, and very much so; but she had better bide her time for
fighting her own battle and that of the rest of the duennas, so as to
crush the calumny of that vile apothecary, and root out the prejudice in
the great Sancho Panza’s mind.”
</p>
<p>
To which Sancho replied, “Ever since I have sniffed the governorship
I have got rid of the humours of a squire, and I don’t care a wild
fig for all the duennas in the world.”
</p>
<p>
They would have carried on this duenna dispute further had they not heard
the notes of the fife and drums once more, from which they concluded that
the Distressed Duenna was making her entrance. The duchess asked the duke
if it would be proper to go out to receive her, as she was a countess and
a person of rank.
</p>
<p>
“In respect of her being a countess,” said Sancho, before the
duke could reply, “I am for your highnesses going out to receive
her; but in respect of her being a duenna, it is my opinion you should not
stir a step.”
</p>
<p>
“Who bade thee meddle in this, Sancho?” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“Who, señor?” said Sancho; “I meddle for I have a right
to meddle, as a squire who has learned the rules of courtesy in the school
of your worship, the most courteous and best-bred knight in the whole
world of courtliness; and in these things, as I have heard your worship
say, as much is lost by a card too many as by a card too few, and to one
who has his ears open, few words.”
</p>
<p>
“Sancho is right,” said the duke; “we’ll see what
the countess is like, and by that measure the courtesy that is due to her.”
</p>
<p>
And now the drums and fife made their entrance as before; and here the
author brought this short chapter to an end and began the next, following
up the same adventure, which is one of the most notable in the history.
