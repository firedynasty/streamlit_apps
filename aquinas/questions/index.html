<h1>Summa Theologica</h1>
<h2>Part I (Prima Pars)</h2>
<h3>St. Thomas Aquinas</h3>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><a href="ST1_Q001.html">Question 1: THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF SACRED DOCTRINE</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q002.html">Question 2: Because the chief aim of sacred doctrine is to teach the knowledge of
God, not only as He is in Himself, but also as He is the beginning of
things and their last end, and especially of rational creatures, as is
clear from what has been already said, therefore, in our endeavor to
expound this science, we shall treat:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q003.html">Question 3: When the existence of a thing has been ascertained there remains the
further question of the manner of its existence, in order that we may
know its essence. Now, because we cannot know what God is, but rather
what He is not, we have no means for considering how God is, but
rather how He is not.</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q004.html">Question 4: Having considered the divine simplicity, we treat next of God's
perfection. Now because everything in so far as it is perfect is
called good, we shall speak first of the divine perfection; secondly
of the divine goodness.</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q005.html">Question 5: We next consider goodness: First, goodness in general. Secondly, the
goodness of God.</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q006.html">Question 6: We next consider the goodness of God; under which head there are four
points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q007.html">Question 7: After considering the divine perfection we must consider the divine
infinity, and God's existence in things: for God is everywhere, and in
all things, inasmuch as He is boundless and infinite.</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q008.html">Question 8: Since it evidently belongs to the infinite to be present everywhere,
and in all things, we now consider whether this belongs to God; and
concerning this there arise four points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q009.html">Question 9: We next consider God's immutability, and His eternity following on His
immutability. On the immutability of God there are two points of
inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q010.html">Question 10: We must now consider the eternity of God, concerning which arise six
points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q011.html">Question 11: After the foregoing, we consider the divine unity; concerning which
there are four points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q012.html">Question 12: As hitherto we have considered God as He is in Himself, we now go on
to consider in what manner He is in the knowledge of creatures;
concerning which there are thirteen points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q013.html">Question 13: After the consideration of those things which belong to the divine
knowledge, we now proceed to the consideration of the divine names.
For everything is named by us according to our knowledge of it.</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q014.html">Question 14: Having considered what belongs to the divine substance, we have now
to treat of God's operation. And since one kind of operation is
immanent, and another kind of operation proceeds to the exterior
effect, we treat first of knowledge and of will (for understanding
abides in the intelligent agent, and will is in the one who wills);
and afterwards of the power of God, the principle of the divine
operation as proceeding to the exterior effect. Now because to
understand is a kind of life, after treating of the divine knowledge,
we consider the divine life. And as knowledge concerns truth, we
consider truth and falsehood. Further, as everything known is in the
knower, and the types of things as existing in the knowledge of God
are called ideas, to the consideration of knowledge will be added the
treatment of ideas.</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q015.html">Question 15: FIRST ARTICLE [I, Q. 15, Art. 1]</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q016.html">Question 16: Since knowledge is of things that are true, after the consideration
of the knowledge of God, we must inquire concerning truth. About this
there are eight points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q017.html">Question 17: We next consider falsity. About this four points of inquiry arise:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q018.html">Question 18: Since to understand belongs to living beings, after considering the
divine knowledge and intellect, we must consider the divine life.
About this, four points of inquiry arise:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q019.html">Question 19: After considering the things belonging to the divine knowledge, we
consider what belongs to the divine will. The first consideration is
about the divine will itself; the second about what belongs strictly
to His will; the third about what belongs to the intellect in
relation to His will. About His will itself there are twelve points
of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q020.html">Question 20: We next consider those things that pertain absolutely to the will of
God. In the appetitive part of the soul there are found in ourselves
both the passions of the soul, as joy, love, and the like; and the
habits of the moral virtues, as justice, fortitude and the like.
Hence we shall first consider the love of God, and secondly His
justice and mercy. About the first there are four points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q021.html">Question 21: After considering the divine love, we must treat of God's justice and
mercy. Under this head there are four points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q022.html">Question 22: Having considered all that relates to the will absolutely, we must
now proceed to those things which have relation to both the intellect
and the will, namely providence, in respect to all created things;
predestination and reprobation and all that is connected with these
acts in respect especially of man as regards his eternal salvation.
For in the science of morals, after the moral virtues themselves,
comes the consideration of prudence, to which providence would seem
to belong. Concerning God's providence there are four points of
inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q023.html">Question 23: After consideration of divine providence, we must treat of
predestination and the book of life. Concerning predestination there
are eight points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q024.html">Question 24: We now consider the book of life; concerning which there are three
points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q025.html">Question 25: After considering the divine foreknowledge and will, and other things
pertaining thereto, it remains for us to consider the power of God.
About this are six points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q026.html">Question 26: After considering all that pertains to the unity of the divine
essence, we come to treat of the divine beatitude. Concerning this,
there are four points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q027.html">Question 27: Having considered what belongs to the unity of the divine essence, it
remains to treat of what belongs to the Trinity of the persons in God.
And because the divine Persons are distinguished from each other
according to the relations of origin, the order of the doctrine leads
us to consider firstly, the question of origin or procession;
secondly, the relations of origin; thirdly, the persons.</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q028.html">Question 28: The divine relations are next to be considered, in four points of
inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q029.html">Question 29: Having premised what have appeared necessary notions concerning the
processions and the relations, we must now approach the subject of the
persons.</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q030.html">Question 30: We are now led to consider the plurality of the persons: about which
there are four points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q031.html">Question 31: We now consider what belongs to the unity or plurality in God; which
gives rise to four points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q032.html">Question 32: We proceed to inquire concerning the knowledge of the divine persons;
and this involves four points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q033.html">Question 33: FIRST ARTICLE [I, Q. 33, Art. 1]</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q034.html">Question 34: We next consider the person of the Son. Three names are attributed to
the Son—namely, "Son," "Word," and "Image." The idea of Son is
gathered from the idea of Father. Hence it remains for us to consider
Word and Image.</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q035.html">Question 35: We next inquire concerning the image: about which there are two points
of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q036.html">Question 36: FIRST ARTICLE [I, Q. 36, Art. 1]</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q037.html">Question 37: We now inquire concerning the name "Love," on which arise two points
of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q038.html">Question 38: There now follows the consideration of the Gift; concerning which
there are two points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q039.html">Question 39: Those things considered which belong to the divine persons absolutely,
we next treat of what concerns the person in reference to the essence,
to the properties, and to the notional acts; and of the comparison of
these with each other.</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q040.html">Question 40: We now consider the persons in connection with the relations, or
properties; and there are four points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q041.html">Question 41: We now consider the persons in reference to the notional acts,
concerning which six points of inquiry arise:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q042.html">Question 42: We now have to consider the persons as compared to one another:
firstly, with regard to equality and likeness; secondly, with regard
to mission. Concerning the first there are six points of inquiry.</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q043.html">Question 43: We next consider the mission of the divine persons, concerning which
there are eight points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q044.html">Question 44: After treating of the procession of the divine persons, we must
consider the procession of creatures from God. This consideration
will be threefold:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q045.html">Question 45: The next question concerns the mode of the emanation of things from
the First Principle, and this is called creation, and includes eight
points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q046.html">Question 46: Next must be considered the beginning of the duration of creatures,
about which there are three points for treatment:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q047.html">Question 47: After considering the production of creatures, we come to the
consideration of the distinction of things. This consideration will be
threefold—first, of the distinction of things in general; secondly,
of the distinction of good and evil; thirdly, of the distinction of
the spiritual and corporeal creature.</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q048.html">Question 48: We must now consider the distinction of things in particular; and
firstly the distinction of good and evil; and then the distinction of
the spiritual and corporeal creatures.</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q049.html">Question 49: We next inquire into the cause of evil. Concerning this there are
three points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q050.html">Question 50: Now we consider the distinction of corporeal and spiritual creatures:
firstly, the purely spiritual creature which in Holy Scripture is
called angel; secondly, the creature wholly corporeal; thirdly, the
composite creature, corporeal and spiritual, which is man.</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q051.html">Question 51: We next inquire about the angels in comparison with corporeal things;
and in the first place about their comparison with bodies; secondly,
of the angels in comparison with corporeal places; and, thirdly, of
their comparison with local movement.</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q052.html">Question 52: We now inquire into the place of the angels. Touching this there are
three subjects of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q053.html">Question 53: We must next consider the local movement of the angels; under which
heading there are three points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q054.html">Question 54: After considering what belongs to the angel's substance, we now
proceed to his knowledge. This investigation will be fourfold. In
the first place inquiry must be made into his power of knowledge:
secondly, into his medium of knowledge: thirdly, into the objects
known: and fourthly, into the manner whereby he knows them.</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q055.html">Question 55: Next in order, the question arises as to the medium of the angelic
knowledge. Under this heading there are three points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q056.html">Question 56: We now inquire into the knowledge of the angels with regard to the
objects known by them. We shall treat of their knowledge, first, of
immaterial things, secondly of things material. Under the first
heading there are three points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q057.html">Question 57: We next investigate the material objects which are known by the
angels. Under this heading there are five points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q058.html">Question 58: After the foregoing we have now to treat of the mode of the angelic
knowledge, concerning which there are seven points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q059.html">Question 59: In the next place we must treat of things concerning the will of
the angels. In the first place we shall treat of the will itself;
secondly, of its movement, which is love. Under the first heading
there are four points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q060.html">Question 60: The next subject for our consideration is that act of the will which
is love or dilection; because every act of the appetitive faculty
comes of love.</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q061.html">Question 61: After dealing with the nature of the angels, their knowledge and will,
it now remains for us to treat of their creation, or, speaking in a
general way, of their origin. Such consideration is threefold. In the
first place we must see how they were brought into natural existence;
secondly, how they were made perfect in grace or glory; and thirdly,
how some of them became wicked.</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q062.html">Question 62: In due sequence we have to inquire how the angels were made in the
order of grace and of glory; under which heading there are nine
points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q063.html">Question 63: In the next place we must consider how angels became evil: first of
all with regard to the evil of fault; and secondly, as to the evil
of punishment. Under the first heading there are nine points for
consideration:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q064.html">Question 64: It now remains as a sequel to deal with the punishment of the demons;
under which heading there are four points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q065.html">Question 65: From the consideration of spiritual creatures we proceed to that of
corporeal creatures, in the production of which, as Holy Scripture
makes mention, three works are found, namely, the work of creation, as
given in the words, "In the beginning God created heaven and earth";
the work of distinction as given in the words, "He divided the light
from the darkness, and the waters that are above the firmament from
the waters that are under the firmament"; and the work of adornment,
expressed thus, "Let there be lights in the firmament."</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q066.html">Question 66: We must next consider the work of distinction; first, the ordering
of creation towards distinction; secondly, the distinction itself.
Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q067.html">Question 67: We must consider next the work of distinction in itself. First, the
work of the first day; secondly, the work of the second day; thirdly
the work of the third day.</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q068.html">Question 68: We must next consider the work of the second day. Under this head
there are four points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q069.html">Question 69: We next consider the work of the third day. Under this head there are
two points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q070.html">Question 70: We must next consider the work of adornment, first as to each day by
itself, secondly as to all seven days in general.</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q071.html">Question 71: We must next consider the work of the fifth day.</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q072.html">Question 72: We must now consider the work of the sixth day.</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q073.html">Question 73: FIRST ARTICLE [I, Q. 73, Art. 1]</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q074.html">Question 74: We next consider all the seven days in common: and there are three
points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q075.html">Question 75: Having treated of the spiritual and of the corporeal creature, we now
proceed to treat of man, who is composed of a spiritual and corporeal
substance. We shall treat first of the nature of man, and secondly of
his origin. Now the theologian considers the nature of man in relation
to the soul; but not in relation to the body, except in so far as the
body has relation to the soul. Hence the first object of our
consideration will be the soul. And since Dionysius (Ang. Hier. xi)
says that three things are to be found in spiritual
substances—essence, power, and operation—we shall treat first of
what belongs to the essence of the soul; secondly, of what belongs to
its power; thirdly, of what belongs to its operation.</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q076.html">Question 76: We now consider the union of the soul with the body; and concerning
this there are eight points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q077.html">Question 77: We proceed to consider those things which belong to the powers of the
soul; first, in general, secondly, in particular. Under the first head
there are eight points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q078.html">Question 78: We next treat of the powers of the soul specifically. The theologian,
however, has only to inquire specifically concerning the intellectual
and appetitive powers, in which the virtues reside. And since the
knowledge of these powers depends to a certain extent on the other
powers, our consideration of the powers of the soul taken
specifically will be divided into three parts: first, we shall
consider those powers which are a preamble to the intellect;
secondly, the intellectual powers; thirdly, the appetitive powers.</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q079.html">Question 79: The next question concerns the intellectual powers, under which head
there are thirteen points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q080.html">Question 80: Next we consider the appetitive powers, concerning which there are
four heads of consideration: first, the appetitive powers in general;
second, sensuality; third, the will; fourth, the free-will. Under the
first there are two points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q081.html">Question 81: Next we have to consider the power of sensuality, concerning which
there are three points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q082.html">Question 82: We next consider the will. Under this head there are five points of
inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q083.html">Question 83: We now inquire concerning free-will. Under this head there are four
points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q084.html">Question 84: We now have to consider the acts of the soul in regard to the
intellectual and the appetitive powers: for the other powers of the
soul do not come directly under the consideration of the theologian.
Furthermore, the acts of the appetitive part of the soul come under
the consideration of the science of morals; wherefore we shall treat
of them in the second part of this work, to which the consideration
of moral matters belongs. But of the acts of the intellectual part
we shall treat now.</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q085.html">Question 85: We come now to consider the mode and order of understanding. Under
this head there are eight points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q086.html">Question 86: FIRST ARTICLE [I, Q. 86, Art. 4]</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q087.html">Question 87: We have now to consider how the intellectual soul knows itself and
all within itself. Under this head there are four points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q088.html">Question 88: We must now consider how the human soul knows what is above itself,
viz. immaterial substances. Under this head there are three points of
inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q089.html">Question 89: We must now consider the knowledge of the separated soul. Under this
head there are eight points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q090.html">Question 90: After the foregoing we must consider the first production of man,
concerning which there are four subjects of treatment:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q091.html">Question 91: We have now to consider the production of the first man's body. Under
this head there are four points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q092.html">Question 92: We must next consider the production of the woman. Under this head
there are four points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q093.html">Question 93: We now treat of the end or term of man's production, inasmuch as he is
said to be made "to the image and likeness of God." There are under
this head nine points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q094.html">Question 94: We next consider the state or condition of the first man; first, as
regards his soul; secondly, as regards his body. Concerning the first
there are two things to be considered:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q095.html">Question 95: We next consider what belongs to the will of the first man; concerning
which there are two points of treatment:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q096.html">Question 96: We next consider the mastership which belonged to man in the state of
innocence. Under this head there are four points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q097.html">Question 97: We next consider what belongs to the bodily state of the first man:
first, as regards the preservation of the individual; secondly, as
regards the preservation of the species.</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q098.html">Question 98: We next consider what belongs to the preservation of the species; and,
first, of generation; secondly, of the state of the offspring. Under
the first head there are two points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q099.html">Question 99: We must now consider the condition of the offspring—first, as
regards the body; secondly, as regards virtue; thirdly, in knowledge.
Under the first head there are two points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q100.html">Question 100: We now have to consider the condition of the offspring as to
righteousness. Under this head there are two points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q101.html">Question 101: FIRST ARTICLE [I, Q. 101, Art. 1]</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q102.html">Question 102: We next consider man's abode, which is paradise. Under this head there
are four points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q103.html">Question 103: Having considered the creation of things and their distinction, we
now consider in the third place the government thereof, and (1) the
government of things in general; (2) in particular, the effects of
this government. Under the first head there are eight points of
inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q104.html">Question 104: We next consider the effects of the Divine government in particular;
concerning which four points of inquiry arise:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q105.html">Question 105: We now consider the second effect of the Divine government, i.e. the
change of creatures; and first, the change of creatures by God;
secondly, the change of one creature by another.</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q106.html">Question 106: We next consider how one creature moves another. This consideration
will be threefold:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q107.html">Question 107: We next consider the speech of the angels. Here there are five points
of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q108.html">Question 108: We next consider the degrees of the angels in their hierarchies and
orders; for it was said above (Q. 106, A. 3), that the superior
angels enlighten the inferior angels; and not conversely.</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q109.html">Question 109: We now consider the ordering of the bad angels; concerning which there
are four points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q110.html">Question 110: FIRST ARTICLE [I, Q. 110, Art. 1]</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q111.html">Question 111: We now consider the action of the angels on man, and inquire:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q112.html">Question 112: We next consider the mission of the angels. Under this head arise
four points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q113.html">Question 113: We next consider the guardianship exercised by the good angels; and
their warfare against the bad angels. Under the first head eight
points of inquiry arise:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q114.html">Question 114: We now consider the assaults of the demons. Under this head there are
five points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q115.html">Question 115: We have now to consider the action of the corporeal creature; and
fate, which is ascribed to certain bodies. Concerning corporeal
actions there are six points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q117.html">Question 117: We have next to consider those things which pertain to the action of
man, who is composed of a created corporeal and spiritual nature. In
the first place we shall consider that action (in general) and
secondly in regard to the propagation of man from man. As to the
first, there are four points of inquiry:</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q118.html">Question 118: We next consider the production of man from man: first, as to the
soul; secondly, as to the body.</a></li><li><a href="ST1_Q119.html">Question 119: We now consider the propagation of man, as to the body. Concerning
this there are two points of inquiry:</a></li>
