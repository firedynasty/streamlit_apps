<p id="id00679">THE UNITY OF GOD<br>

(In Four Articles)<br>
</p>

<p id="id00680">After the foregoing, we consider the divine unity; concerning which
there are four points of inquiry:</p>

<p id="id00681">(1) Whether "one" adds anything to "being"?</p>

<p id="id00682">(2) Whether "one" and "many" are opposed to each other?</p>

<p id="id00683">(3) Whether God is one?</p>

<p id="id00684">(4) Whether He is in the highest degree one?
_______________________</p>

<a id="art1"></a><p id="id00685">FIRST ARTICLE [I, Q. 11, Art. 1]</p>

<p id="id00686">Whether "One" Adds Anything to "Being"?</p>

<p id="id00687">Objection 1: It seems that "one" adds something to "being." For
everything is in a determinate genus by addition to being, which
penetrates all <i>genera.</i> But "one" is a determinate genus, for it is
the principle of number, which is a species of quantity. Therefore
"one" adds something to "being."</p>

<p id="id00688">Obj. 2: Further, what divides a thing common to all, is an
addition to it. But "being" is divided by "one" and by "many."
Therefore "one" is an addition to "being."</p>

<p id="id00689">Obj. 3: Further, if "one" is not an addition to "being," "one"
and "being" must have the same meaning. But it would be nugatory to
call "being" by the name of "being"; therefore it would be equally so
to call being "one." Now this is false. Therefore "one" is an addition
to "being."</p>

<p id="id00690"><i>On the contrary,</i> Dionysius says (Div. Nom. 5, ult.): "Nothing which
exists is not in some way one," which would be false if "one" were an
addition to "being," in the sense of limiting it. Therefore "one" is
not an addition to "being."</p>

<p id="id00691"><i>I answer that,</i> "One" does not add any reality to "being"; but is only
a negation of division; for "one" means undivided "being." This is the
very reason why "one" is the same as "being." Now every being is
either simple or compound. But what is simple is undivided, both
actually and potentially. Whereas what is compound, has not being
whilst its parts are divided, but after they make up and compose it.
Hence it is manifest that the being of anything consists in
undivision; and hence it is that everything guards its unity as it
guards its being.</p>

<p id="id00692">Reply Obj. 1: Some, thinking that the "one" convertible with "being"
is the same as the "one" which is the principle of number, were
divided into contrary opinions. Pythagoras and Plato, seeing that the
"one" convertible with "being" did not add any reality to "being,"
but signified the substance of "being" as undivided, thought that the
same applied to the "one" which is the principle of number. And
because number is composed of unities, they thought that numbers were
the substances of all things. Avicenna, however, on the contrary,
considering that "one" which is the principle of number, added a
reality to the substance of "being" (otherwise number made of unities
would not be a species of quantity), thought that the "one"
convertible with "being" added a reality to the substance of beings;
as "white" to "man." This, however, is manifestly false, inasmuch as
each thing is "one" by its substance. For if a thing were "one" by
anything else but by its substance, since this again would be "one,"
supposing it were again "one" by another thing, we should be driven
on to infinity. Hence we must adhere to the former statement;
therefore we must say that the "one" which is convertible with
"being," does not add a reality to being; but that the "one" which is
the principle of number, does add a reality to "being," belonging to
the genus of quantity.</p>

<p id="id00693">Reply Obj. 2: There is nothing to prevent a thing which in one way is
divided, from being another way undivided; as what is divided in
number, may be undivided in species; thus it may be that a thing is
in one way "one," and in another way "many." Still, if it is
absolutely undivided, either because it is so according to what
belongs to its essence, though it may be divided as regards what is
outside its essence, as what is one in subject may have many
accidents; or because it is undivided actually, and divided
potentially, as what is "one" in the whole, and is "many" in parts;
in such a case a thing will be "one" absolutely and "many"
accidentally. On the other hand, if it be undivided accidentally, and
divided absolutely, as if it were divided in essence and undivided in
idea or in principle or cause, it will be "many" absolutely and "one"
accidentally; as what are "many" in number and "one" in species or
"one" in principle. Hence in that way, being is divided by "one" and
by "many"; as it were by "one" absolutely and by "many" accidentally.
For multitude itself would not be contained under "being," unless it
were in some way contained under "one." Thus Dionysius says (Div.
Nom., cap. ult.) that "there is no kind of multitude that is not in
a way one. But what are many in their parts, are one in their whole;
and what are many in accidents, are one in subject; and what are many
in number, are one in species; and what are many in species, are one
in genus; and what are many in processions, are one in principle."</p>

<p id="id00694">Reply Obj. 3: It does not follow that it is nugatory to say
"being" is "one"; forasmuch as "one" adds an idea to "being."

<a id="art2"></a><p id="id00695">SECOND ARTICLE [I, Q. 11, Art. 2]</p>

<p id="id00696">Whether "One" and "Many" Are Opposed to Each Other?</p>

<p id="id00697">Objection 1: It seems that "one" and "many" are not mutually opposed.
For no opposite thing is predicated of its opposite. But every
<i>multitude</i> is in a certain way <i>one,</i> as appears from the preceding
article. Therefore "one" is not opposed to "multitude."</p>

<p id="id00698">Obj. 2: Further, no opposite thing is constituted by its
opposite. But <i>multitude</i> is constituted by <i>one.</i> Therefore it is not
opposed to "multitude."</p>

<p id="id00699">Obj. 3: Further, "one" is opposed to "one." But the idea of "few"
is opposed to "many." Therefore "one" is not opposed to "many."</p>

<p id="id00700">Obj. 4: Further, if "one" is opposed to "multitude," it is
opposed as the undivided is to the divided; and is thus opposed to it
as privation is to habit. But this appears to be incongruous; because
it would follow that "one" comes after "multitude," and is defined by
it; whereas, on the contrary, "multitude" is defined by "one." Hence
there would be a vicious circle in the definition; which is
inadmissible. Therefore "one" and "many" are not opposed.</p>

<p id="id00701"><i>On the contrary,</i> Things which are opposed in idea, are themselves
opposed to each other. But the idea of "one" consists in
indivisibility; and the idea of "multitude" contains division.
Therefore "one" and "many" are opposed to each other.</p>

<p id="id00702"><i>I answer that,</i> "One" is opposed to "many," but in various ways. The
<i>one</i> which is the principle of number is opposed to <i>multitude</i> which
is number, as the measure is to the thing measured. For "one" implies
the idea of a primary measure; and number is <i>multitude</i> measured by
<i>one,</i> as is clear from <i>Metaph.</i> x. But the <i>one</i> which is convertible
with <i>being</i> is opposed to <i>multitude</i> by way of privation; as the
undivided is to the thing divided.</p>

<p id="id00703">Reply Obj. 1: No privation entirely takes away the being of a thing,
inasmuch as privation means "negation in the subject," according to
the Philosopher (Categor. viii). Nevertheless every privation takes
away some being; and so in being, by reason of its universality, the
privation of being has its foundation in being; which is not the case
in privations of special forms, as of sight, or of whiteness and the
like. And what applies to being applies also to one and to good,
which are convertible with being, for the privation of good is
founded in some good; likewise the removal of unity is founded in
some one thing. Hence it happens that multitude is some one thing;
and evil is some good thing, and non-being is some kind of being.
Nevertheless, opposite is not predicated of opposite; forasmuch as
one is absolute, and the other is relative; for what is relative
being (as a potentiality) is non-being absolutely, i.e. actually; or
what is absolute being in the genus of substance is non-being
relatively as regards some accidental being. In the same way, what is
relatively good is absolutely bad, or vice versa; likewise what is
absolutely <i>one</i> is relatively <i>many,</i> and vice versa.</p>

<p id="id00704">Reply Obj. 2: A <i>whole</i> is twofold. In one sense it is homogeneous,
composed of like parts; in another sense it is heterogeneous,
composed of dissimilar parts. Now in every homogeneous whole, the
whole is made up of parts having the form of the whole; as, for
instance, every part of water is water; and such is the constitution
of a continuous thing made up of its parts. In every heterogeneous
whole, however, every part is wanting in the form belonging to the
whole; as, for instance, no part of a house is a house, nor is any
part of a man a man. Now multitude is such a kind of a whole.
Therefore inasmuch as its part has not the form of the multitude, the
latter is composed of unities, as a house is composed of not houses;
not, indeed, as if unities constituted multitude so far as they are
undivided, in which way they are opposed to multitude; but so far as
they have being, as also the parts of a house make up the house by
the fact that they are beings, not by the fact that they are not
houses.</p>

<p id="id00705">Reply Obj. 3: "Many" is taken in two ways: absolutely, and in that
sense it is opposed to "one"; in another way as importing some kind
of excess, in which sense it is opposed to "few"; hence in the first
sense two are many but not in the second sense.</p>

<p id="id00706">Reply Obj. 4: "One" is opposed to "many" privatively, inasmuch as the
idea of "many" involves division. Hence division must be prior to
unity, not absolutely in itself, but according to our way of
apprehension. For we apprehend simple things by compound things; and
hence we define a point to be, "what has no part," or "the beginning
of a line." "Multitude" also, in idea, follows on "one"; because we
do not understand divided things to convey the idea of multitude
except by the fact that we attribute unity to every part. Hence "one"
is placed in the definition of "multitude"; but "multitude" is not
placed in the definition of "one." But division comes to be
understood from the very negation of being: so what first comes to
mind is being; secondly, that this being is not that being, and thus
we apprehend division as a consequence; thirdly, comes the notion of
one; fourthly, the notion of multitude.

<a id="art3"></a><p id="id00707">THIRD ARTICLE [I, Q. 11, Art. 3]</p>

<p id="id00708">Whether God Is One?</p>

<p id="id00709">Objection 1: It seems that God is not one. For it is written "For
there be many gods and many lords" (1 Cor. 8:5).</p>

<p id="id00710">Obj. 2: Further, "One," as the principle of number, cannot be
predicated of God, since quantity is not predicated of God; likewise,
neither can "one" which is convertible with "being" be predicated of
God, because it imports privation, and every privation is an
imperfection, which cannot apply to God. Therefore God is not one.</p>

<p id="id00711"><i>On the contrary,</i> It is written "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is
one Lord" (Deut. 6:4).</p>

<p id="id00712"><i>I answer that,</i> It can be shown from these three sources that God is
one. First from His simplicity. For it is manifest that the reason why
any singular thing is "this particular thing" is because it cannot be
communicated to many: since that whereby Socrates is a man, can be
communicated to many; whereas, what makes him this particular man, is
only communicable to one. Therefore, if Socrates were a man by what
makes him to be this particular man, as there cannot be many Socrates,
so there could not in that way be many men. Now this belongs to God
alone; for God Himself is His own nature, as was shown above
(Q. 3, A. 3). Therefore, in the very same way God is God, and He
is this God. Impossible is it therefore that many Gods should exist.</p>

<p id="id00713">Secondly, this is proved from the infinity of His perfection. For it
was shown above (Q. 4, A. 2) that God comprehends in Himself the
whole perfection of being. If then many gods existed, they would
necessarily differ from each other. Something therefore would belong
to one which did not belong to another. And if this were a privation,
one of them would not be absolutely perfect; but if a perfection, one
of them would be without it. So it is impossible for many gods to
exist. Hence also the ancient philosophers, constrained as it were by
truth, when they asserted an infinite principle, asserted likewise
that there was only one such principle.</p>

<p id="id00714">Thirdly, this is shown from the unity of the world. For all things
that exist are seen to be ordered to each other since some serve
others. But things that are diverse do not harmonize in the same
order, unless they are ordered thereto by one. For many are reduced
into one order by one better than by many: because one is the <i>per se</i>
cause of one, and many are only the accidental cause of one, inasmuch
as they are in some way one. Since therefore what is first is most
perfect, and is so <i>per se</i> and not accidentally, it must be that the
first which reduces all into one order should be only one. And this
one is God.</p>

<p id="id00715">Reply Obj. 1: Gods are called many by the error of some who
worshipped many deities, thinking as they did that the planets and
other stars were gods, and also the separate parts of the world.
Hence the Apostle adds: "Our God is one," etc.</p>

<p id="id00716">Reply Obj. 2: "One" which is the principle of number is not
predicated of God, but only of material things. For "one" the
principle of number belongs to the genus of mathematics, which are
material in being, and abstracted from matter only in idea. But "one"
which is convertible with being is a metaphysical entity and does not
depend on matter in its being. And although in God there is no
privation, still, according to the mode of our apprehension, He is
known to us by way only of privation and remotion. Thus there is no
reason why a certain kind of privation should not be predicated of
God; for instance, that He is incorporeal and infinite; and in the
same way it is said of God that He is one.

<a id="art4"></a><p id="id00717">FOURTH ARTICLE [I, Q. 11, Art. 4]</p>

<p id="id00718">Whether God Is Supremely One?</p>

<p id="id00719">Objection 1: It seems that God is not supremely <i>one.</i> For "one" is so
called from the privation of division. But privation cannot be greater
or less. Therefore God is not more "one" than other things which are
called "one."</p>

<p id="id00720">Obj. 2: Further, nothing seems to be more indivisible than what
is actually and potentially indivisible; such as a point and unity.
But a thing is said to be more "one" according as it is indivisible.
Therefore God is not more <i>one</i> than unity is <i>one</i> and a point is
<i>one.</i></p>

<p id="id00721">Obj. 3: Further, what is essentially good is supremely good.
Therefore what is essentially <i>one</i> is supremely <i>one.</i> But every
being is essentially <i>one,</i> as the Philosopher says (Metaph. iv).
Therefore every being is supremely <i>one;</i> and therefore God is not
<i>one</i> more than any other being is <i>one.</i></p>

<p id="id00722"><i>On the contrary,</i> Bernard says (De Consid. v): "Among all things called
one, the unity of the Divine Trinity holds the first place."</p>

<p id="id00723"><i>I answer that,</i> Since <i>one</i> is an undivided being, if anything is
supremely <i>one</i> it must be supremely being, and supremely undivided.
Now both of these belong to God. For He is supremely being, inasmuch
as His being is not determined by any nature to which it is adjoined;
since He is being itself, subsistent, absolutely undetermined. But He
is supremely undivided inasmuch as He is divided neither actually nor
potentially, by any mode of division; since He is altogether simple,
as was shown above (Q. 3, A. 7). Hence it is manifest that God is
<i>one</i> in the supreme degree.</p>

<p id="id00724">Reply Obj. 1: Although privation considered in itself is not
susceptive of more or less, still according as its opposite is
subject to more or less, privation also can be considered itself in
the light of more and less. Therefore according as a thing is more
divided, or is divisible, either less or not at all, in the degree it
is called more, or less, or supremely, <i>one.</i></p>

<p id="id00725">Reply Obj. 2: A point and unity which is the principle of number, are
not supremely being, inasmuch as they have being only in some
subject. Hence neither of them can be supremely <i>one.</i> For as a
subject cannot be supremely <i>one,</i> because of the difference within
it of accident and subject, so neither can an accident.</p>

<p id="id00726">Reply Obj. 3: Although every being is <i>one</i> by its substance, still
every such substance is not equally the cause of unity; for the
substance of some things is compound and of others simple.
